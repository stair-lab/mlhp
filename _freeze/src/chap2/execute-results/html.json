Active learning (AL) is a machine learning paradigm that aims to reduce the amount of labeled data required to train a model to achieve high accuracy. AL algorithms iteratively select an input datapoint for an oracle (e.g., a human annotator) to label such that when the label is observed, the model improves the most. Two primary setups in AL is pool-based and stream-based. In pool-based AL, the model selects samples from a large unlabeled pool of data. For example, a model for text classification selects the most uncertain texts from a large pool to ask a human annotator to label. In stream-based AL, the model receives samples sequentially (one sample at a time) and decides whether to label them. The data is gone if the decision maker decides not to label it. AL process iterates between (1) Current model trained on current dataset $\\mathcal{D}$, potential points $\\tilde{x}_1 \\dots \\tilde{x}_m$ are being investigated. AL will choose one of them to add to the dataset; and (2) Relative to the model, a proxy highlights the relative value of each point to model improvement  $(v(\\tilde{x}_1) \\dots v(\\tilde{x}_m) )$. The cycle repeats until the budget deplet or a reliability criteria is reached.\n\nAL has successfully enhance various real-world systems. For example, AL can improve the computer vision models used in autonomous vehicles [@AL_app_autonomous]. Probing a model to understand what type of data it would benefit from is more practical. In robotics, autonomous agents may query humans when unsure how to act when facing new situations [@AL_app_robotics]. Here, collecting data often incurs significant financial and time costs because physical robot arm worns out over time. In meteorology, AL can help decide where to place additional sensors for weather predictions [@AL_app_sensors]. Sensor placement involves deploying teams to remote locations and expensive construction for an extra data point. Choosing these locations and allocating resources wisely is of interest to governments and businesses. AL could also be employed to select data for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for specific downstream tasks [@AL_app_LLMs]. Here, it might be difficult to fully describe a targeted NLP task. Often, instead of defining a task via a dataset of examples, it may be easier for a human to interact with the LLM for a specific use case, identify gaps in the model, and address those using AL.\n\nTypically, in robotic, robots learn by observing human demonstrations. However, expert demonstrations are often limited, and training a supervised learning model would require vast amounts of demonstration data, which is difficult to obtain at scale. Demonstrations tend to be variable, reflecting the actions of individual humans, making the data collection process inconsistent. To address these limitations, alternative approaches have been proposed, such as using pairwise comparisons, where humans evaluate two action trajectories to determine the superior one, or employing physical corrections, in which reward functions are learned through human-robot interactions, with humans guiding the robot’s actions during the task.AL algorithms can be employed in preference learning tasks, where the objective is to develop a model that aligns with human preferences while minimizing the need for extensive labeled data or reducing the high cost of annotations. \n\nMotivating by the pairwise preference setting, we consider a binary classification problem. The model is trained on a small labeled dataset $\\mathcal{D} = \\{(x_1, y_1), \\ldots, (x_n, y_n)\\}$, where $x_i$ represents the input data and $y_i$ is the corresponding label. The model is uncertain about the class labels of some data points and can query an oracle to obtain the true labels of these data points. The goal is to minimize the number of queries to the oracle while maximizing the model's performance. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is a critical aspect of AL that allows models to evaluate the informativeness of new data points. In machine learning (ML), two primary types of uncertainty are often considered: epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. Epistemic uncertainty, or model uncertainty, arises from a lack of knowledge and can be reduced by acquiring more data. This type of uncertainty is especially significant when the model lacks confidence due to insufficient or incomplete information in its training set. On the other hand, aleatoric uncertainty, or data uncertainty, stems from the inherent randomness within the data itself. Unlike epistemic uncertainty, aleatoric uncertainty cannot be reduced, even with additional data, as it reflects noise or unpredictability in the real data-generating process. Several approaches exist to quantify uncertainty in AL, each with its strengths and limitations. \n\nBayesian methods, such as Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) and Gaussian Processes (GPs), offer a principled way of estimating uncertainty by incorporating prior knowledge into the model. These approaches can generate meaningful uncertainty estimates that aid in choosing informative samples for labeling. However, they can become computationally prohibitive, especially for large and complex models, limiting their applicability in some practical scenarios. Another common technique for uncertainty quantification is the use of ensemble methods, such as Random Forests or Gradient Boosting Machines. These methods involve training multiple models and combining their predictions to provide an estimate of uncertainty. Ensemble methods are relatively easy to implement and can give valuable insights into model uncertainty. However, they can be computationally expensive and may not always produce well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. Moreover, they do not integrate prior knowledge, which can be a disadvantage in certain applications. Conformal prediction methods also provide a framework for estimating uncertainty by offering a measure of confidence in predictions based on the conformity of a given instance with the training data. While these methods are useful in some contexts, this book focuses primarily on the Bayesian approach due to its theoretical robustness and capacity to quantify uncertainty in a more comprehensive manner.\n\n## Acquisition Function\nUncertainty quantification plays a vital role in acquisition functions, which are central to AL strategies. These functions determine which samples are most valuable to label by evaluating their utility based on the model's current uncertainty estimates. Common acquisition functions include uncertainty sampling [@AL_uncertainty], which selects samples the model is least confident about, query-by-committee [@AL_committee], which utilizes a set of models to choose the most uncertain samples, and Bayesian AL by Disagreement (BALD) [@AL_BALD], which selects samples that maximize information gain by reducing model uncertainty. Through careful uncertainty quantification, acquisition functions guide the AL process, improving the model's efficiency in learning from limited data. Other acquisition functions that can be employed include:\n\n-   Thompson Sampling [@AL_exploreexploit] leverages the Thompson Sampling algorithm to select a posterior sample from the model's distribution and compute the expected utility of labeling using that sample. By doing so, the algorithm balances exploration and exploitation, leading to effective AL.\n\n-   Expected model change [@AL_expmodelchange]: This approach focuses on labeling points that would have the most impact on changing the current model parameters.\n\n-   Expected error reduction [@AL_experrorredn]: Points that would most effectively reduce the model's generalization error are labeled using this strategy.\n\n-   Variance reduction [@AL_variance]: This approach labels points that would minimize output variance, which is one component of error. By selecting points that reduce variability in the model's predictions, it aims to improve overall performance.\n\n-   User Centered Labeling Strategies [@AL_usercentered]: This approach involves actively involving the user in the labeling process by visualizing data through dimensionality reduction techniques. The user then provides labels for the compiled data based on their domain expertise and preferences. This strategy leverages user input to improve the quality and relevance of the labeled data.\n\n-   Querying from diverse subspaces or partitions [@AL_partition]: When using a forest of trees as the underlying model, the leaf nodes can represent overlapping partitions of the feature space. This strategy selects instances from non-overlapping or minimally overlapping partitions for labeling.\n\n-   Conformal prediction [@AL_conformal]: This method predicts that a new data point will have a label similar to old data points in some specified way. The degree of similarity within the old examples is used to estimate the confidence in the prediction.\n\n-   Mismatch-first farthest-traversal [@AL_mismatch]: This strategy first prioritizes data points that are wrongly predicted by the current model compared to the nearest-neighbor prediction. The second criterion is the distance to previously selected data, with preference given to those that are farthest away. The goal is to optimize both the correction of mispredictions and the diversity of the selected data.\n\nUncertainty sampling [@AL_uncertainty] is a widely used acquisition function in AL that selects data points for which the model exhibits the greatest uncertainty. This method aims to improve model performance by focusing labeling efforts on ambiguous samples, where additional information is likely to yield the greatest benefit. Let $x$ represent the input, and $p(y|x)$ the probability distribution of the output $y$ given $x$. Several acquisition strategies fall under uncertainty sampling, including entropy sampling, margin sampling, and least confidence sampling, each providing a unique measure of uncertainty.\n\n-   Entropy sampling measures uncertainty by calculating the entropy of the predicted probability distribution. The acquisition function is given by $\\alpha(x) = - \\sum_{y} p(y|x) \\log p(y|x)$, with higher entropy values indicating higher uncertainty.\n\n-   Margin sampling focuses on the difference between the two highest predicted probabilities for a sample. The acquisition function is given by $\\alpha(x) = p(y_1|x) - p(y_2|x)$, where $y_1$ and $y_2$ are two most likely classes. Smaller margins signify greater uncertainty.\n\n-   Least confidence sampling measures uncertainty by identifying the sample with the lowest predicted probability for its most likely class. The acquisition function is $\\alpha(x) = 1 - p(y_{\\text{max}}|x)$, where $y_{\\text{max}}$ is the class with the highest probability.\n\nExample: Consider a binary classification problem with two classes $y_1$ and $y_2$. We have three samples $x_1, x_2, x_3$ and the corresponding predictive distributions are as follows:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\np(y_1|x_1) &= 0.6, \\quad p(y_2|x_1) = 0.4\\\\\np(y_1|x_2) &= 0.3, \\quad p(y_2|x_2) = 0.7\\\\\np(y_1|x_3) &= 0.8, \\quad p(y_2|x_3) = 0.2\n\\end{aligned}$$ {#eq-eq3.1}\n\n-   Entropy Sampling \n    +   $\\alpha(x_1) = -0.6 \\log (0.6) - 0.4 \\log (0.4) = 0.29$\n    +   $\\alpha(x_2) = -0.3 \\log (0.3) - 0.7 \\log (0.7) = 0.27$\n    +   $\\alpha(x_3) = -0.8 \\log (0.8) - 0.2 \\log (0.2) = 0.22$\n\nWe would select $x_1$ for labeling as it has the highest entropy, indicating the model is most uncertain about its prediction at $x_1$.\n\n-   Margin Sampling \n    +   $\\alpha(x_1) = 0.6 - 0.4 = 0.2$\n    +   $\\alpha(x_2) = 0.7 - 0.3 = 0.4$\n    +   $\\alpha(x_3) = 0.8 - 0.2 = 0.6$\n\nWe would select $x_1$ for labeling as it has the smallest margin, indicating the model is most uncertain about the prediction at $x_1$.\n\n-   Least Confidence Sampling \n    +   $\\alpha(x_1) = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4$\n    +   $\\alpha(x_2) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3$\n    +   $\\alpha(x_3) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2$\n\nWe would select $x_1$ for labeling as it has the lowest confidence, indicating the model is most uncertain about the prediction at $x_1$. In summary, uncertainty sampling methods, whether based on entropy, margin, or least confidence, help prioritize data points that the model struggles with the most. By focusing on these uncertain samples, the model can more efficiently improve its performance, making uncertainty sampling a key tool in AL.\n\nQuery-by-Committee [@AL_committee] is an AL strategy where a committee of models selects samples for labeling based on the level of disagreement among the committee members. Several acquisition functions can be employed under this framework to quantify the disagreement:\n\n-   Vote Entropy: The vote entropy measures the uncertainty based on how often the committee members vote for each class. \n    The acquisition function is defined as $\\alpha(x) = \\mathbb{H}\\left[\\frac{V(y)}{C}\\right]$, where $V(y)$ is the number of \n    votes for class $y$ and $C$ is the number of committee members.\n\n-   Consensus Entropy: This acquisition function measures the entropy of the average probability distribution across committee \n    members. It is given by $\\alpha(x) = \\mathbb{H}[P_C(y|x)]$, where $P_C(y|x)$ is the average probability distribution for sample \n    $x$ across all committee members.\n\n-   KL Divergence: The KL divergence quantifies the disagreement by comparing the probability distribution of each \n    committee member to the average distribution. The acquisition function is given by \n    $\\alpha(x) = \\frac{1}{C} \\sum_{c=1}^{C} D_{KL}[P_c(y|x) || P_C(y|x)]$, \n    where $P_c(y|x)$ is the probability distribution of committee member $c$ and $P_C(y|x)$ is the average distribution \n    across the committee.\n\nConsider a binary classification problem with two classes $y_1$ and $y_2$. We have three committee members and three samples: $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$. The predictive distributions for each committee member are given below:\n\n|   $x$ | $p_1(y_1 \\vert \\cdot)$  | $p_1(y_2 \\vert \\cdot)$ | $p_2(y_1 \\vert \\cdot)$ | $p_2(y_2 \\vert \\cdot)$ | $p_3(y_1 \\vert \\cdot)$ | $p_3(y_2 \\vert \\cdot)$ |\n| ----- | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |\n| $x_1$ | 0.6                   | 0.4                   | 0.7                   | 0.3                   | 0.3                   | 0.7                   |\n| $x_2$ | 0.3                   | 0.7                   | 0.4                   | 0.6                   | 0.4                   | 0.6                   |\n| $x_3$ | 0.8                   | 0.2                   | 0.9                   | 0.1                   | 0.7                   | 0.3                   |\n\nQuery-by-Committee: Vote Entropy\n\n-   For sample $x_1$, the votes for $y_1$ and $y_2$ are $V(y_1) = 2$ and $V(y_2) = 1$. The vote entropy is $\\alpha(x_1) = - \\frac{2}{3} \\log (\\frac{2}{3}) - \\frac{1}{3} \\log (\\frac{1}{3}) = 0.28$.\n-   For sample $x_2$, the votes are $V(y_1) = 0$ and $V(y_2) = 3$, resulting in vote entropy $\\alpha(x_2) = 0$.\n-   For sample $x_3$, the votes are $V(y_1) = 3$ and $V(y_2) = 0$, resulting in vote entropy $\\alpha(x_3) = 0$.\n\nThus, sample $x_1$ would be selected for labeling as it has the highest vote entropy, indicating the greatest disagreement among the committee members.\n\nQuery-by-Committee: Consensus Entropy. The first step is to compute the consensus probability of each class for each sample:\n\n-   For $x_1$, $p_c(y_1|x_1) = \\frac{0.6 + 0.7 + 0.3}{3} = 0.53$ and $p_c(y_2|x_1) = \\frac{0.4 + 0.3 + 0.7}{3} = 0.47$.\n-   For $x_2$, $p_c(y_1|x_2) = \\frac{0.3 + 0.4 + 0.4}{3} = 0.37$ and $p_c(y_2|x_2) = \\frac{0.7 + 0.6 + 0.6}{3} = 0.63$.\n-   For $x_3$, $p_c(y_1|x_3) = \\frac{0.8 + 0.9 + 0.7}{3} = 0.8$ and $p_c(y_2|x_3) = \\frac{0.2 + 0.1 + 0.3}{3} = 0.2$.\n\nNext, we compute the entropy of these consensus probabilities:\n\n-   For $x_1$, $\\mathbb{H}[p_c(y|x_1)] = -0.53 \\log (0.53) - 0.47 \\log (0.47) = 0.30$.\n-   For $x_2$, $\\mathbb{H}[p_c(y|x_2)] = -0.37 \\log (0.37) - 0.63 \\log (0.63) = 0.29$.\n-   For $x_3$, $\\mathbb{H}[p_c(y|x_3)] = -0.8 \\log (0.8) - 0.2 \\log (0.2) = 0.22$.\n\nThus, $x_1$ would be selected for labeling as it has the highest consensus entropy, indicating the highest level of disagreement among the committee members.\n\nBayesian AL by Disagreement (BALD) [@AL_BALD] selects the samples for which the model expects to gain the most Shannon information when corresponding labels are observed:\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{I}(\\theta; y|x, \\mathcal{D}) = \\mathbb{H}[p(y|x, \\mathcal{D})] - \\mathbb{E}_{p(\\theta | \\mathcal{D})} [\\mathbb{H}[p(y|x, \\theta, \\mathcal{D})]]\n$$ {#eq-eq3.2}\n\nwhere $\\mathbb{H}[\\cdot]$ denotes entropy. When there is significant disagreement among models, the predictive entropy (the first term) will be large, while the expected entropy (the second term) will be smaller. This difference represents the degree to which the models disagree. BALD selects points where this disagreement is maximized. The first term is\n$$\\mathbb{H}[p(y|x, \\mathcal{D})] = \\mathbb{H}\\left[\\int_{\\theta} p(y|x, \\theta, \\mathcal{D}) p(\\theta | \\mathcal{D}) d\\theta\\right] \\approx \\mathbb{H}\\left[\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} p(y|x, \\theta_i, \\mathcal{D})\\right] = \\mathbb{H}\\left[\\overline{p}(y|x, \\mathcal{D})\\right]$$\nThe second term is \n$$\\mathbb{E}_{p(\\theta|\\mathcal{D})} [\\mathbb{H}[p(y|x, \\theta, \\mathcal{D})]] = \\mathbb{E}_{p(\\theta|\\mathcal{D})} \\left[ - \\sum_{y} p(y|x, \\theta, \\mathcal{D}) \\log p(y|x, \\theta, \\mathcal{D}) \\right] \\approx - \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left( \\sum_{y} p(y|x, \\theta_i, \\mathcal{D}) \\log p(y|x, \\theta_i, \\mathcal{D}) \\right)$$\n\nExample: Consider a binary classification problem with two classes, $y_1$ and $y_2$. We have two samples, $x_1$ and $x_2$, and the model’s predictive distributions are as follows:\n\n- First-time inference (with $\\theta_1 \\sim p(\\theta | \\mathcal{D})$):\n  $$\n  p(y_1|x_1, \\theta_1, \\mathcal{D}) = 0.6, \\quad p(y_2|x_1, \\theta_1, \\mathcal{D}) = 0.4\n  $$ {#eq-eq3.5}\n  $$\n  p(y_1|x_2, \\theta_1, \\mathcal{D}) = 0.4, \\quad p(y_2|x_2, \\theta_1, \\mathcal{D}) = 0.6\n  $$ {#eq-eq3.6}\n\n- Second-time inference (with $\\theta_2 \\sim p(\\theta | \\mathcal{D})$):\n  $$\n  p(y_1|x_1, \\theta_2, \\mathcal{D}) = 0.8, \\quad p(y_2|x_1, \\theta_2, \\mathcal{D}) = 0.2\n  $$ {#eq-eq3.7}\n  $$\n  p(y_1|x_2, \\theta_2, \\mathcal{D}) = 0.5, \\quad p(y_2|x_2, \\theta_2, \\mathcal{D}) = 0.5\n  $$ {#eq-eq3.8}\n\nSolution:\n\nStep 1: Compute the entropy of the model's predictive distribution for each sample:\n\n-   $\\overline{p}_{\\theta}(y_1|x_1, \\theta, \\mathcal{D}) = 0.7$\n-   $\\overline{p}_{\\theta}(y_2|x_1, \\theta, \\mathcal{D}) = 0.3$\n-   $\\overline{p}_{\\theta}(y_1|x_2, \\theta, \\mathcal{D}) = 0.45$\n-   $\\overline{p}_{\\theta}(y_2|x_2, \\theta, \\mathcal{D}) = 0.55$\n\nNow, we compute the entropy for each sample using the formula:\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{H}[p(y|x, \\mathcal{D})] = - p(y_1|x, \\mathcal{D}) \\log(p(y_1|x, \\mathcal{D})) - p(y_2|x, \\mathcal{D}) \\log(p(y_2|x, \\mathcal{D}))\n$$ {#eq-eq3.9}\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n    &\\mathbb{H}[p(y|x_1, \\mathcal{D})] = - 0.7 \\log(0.7) - 0.3 \\log(0.3) = 0.27 \\\\\n    &\\mathbb{H}[p(y|x_2, \\mathcal{D})] = - 0.45 \\log(0.45) - 0.55 \\log(0.55) = 0.30\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nStep 2: Compute the expected entropy of the model's predictive distribution for each sample.\nFor $x_1$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n    &\\mathbb{H}_{\\theta_1}[p(y|x_1, \\theta, \\mathcal{D})] = -0.6 \\log(0.6) - 0.4 \\log(0.4) = 0.29 \\\\\n    &\\mathbb{H}_{\\theta_2}[p(y|x_1, \\theta, \\mathcal{D})] = -0.8 \\log(0.8) - 0.2 \\log(0.2) = 0.22 \\\\\n    &\\mathbb{E}_{p(\\theta|\\mathcal{D})}[\\mathbb{H}[p(y|x_1, \\theta, \\mathcal{D})]] \\approx \\frac{0.29 + 0.22}{2} = 0.255\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFor $x_2$:\n\n-   $\\mathbb{H}_{\\theta_1}[p(y|x_2, \\theta, \\mathcal{D})] = -0.4 \\log(0.4) - 0.6 \\log(0.6) = 0.29$\n-   $\\mathbb{H}_{\\theta_2}[p(y|x_2, \\theta, \\mathcal{D})] = -0.5 \\log(0.5) - 0.5 \\log(0.5) = 0.30$\n\nAverage the results:\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_{p(\\theta|\\mathcal{D})}[\\mathbb{H}[p(y|x_2, \\theta, \\mathcal{D})]] \\approx \\frac{0.29 + 0.30}{2} = 0.295\n$$ {#eq-eq3.13}\n\nStep 3: Compute the BALD score for each sample. The BALD score $\\alpha(x)$ is the difference between the predictive entropy and the expected entropy:\n\n$$\n\\alpha(x_1) = \\mathbb{H}[p(y|x_1, \\mathcal{D})] - \\mathbb{E}_{p(\\theta|\\mathcal{D})}[\\mathbb{H}[p(y|x_1, \\theta, \\mathcal{D})]] = 0.27 - 0.255 = 0.015\n$$\n\n$$\n\\alpha(x_2) = \\mathbb{H}[p(y|x_2, \\mathcal{D})] - \\mathbb{E}_{p(\\theta|\\mathcal{D})}[\\mathbb{H}[p(y|x_2, \\theta, \\mathcal{D})]] = 0.30 - 0.295 = 0.005\n$$\n\nWe would select $x_1$ for labeling since it has the highest BALD score, indicating that labeling $x_1$ will provide the most information gain for the model.\n\nAL by Variance Reduction [@AL_variance] is an algorithm designed to select the next data point for labeling based on the anticipated reduction in the model's variance. The objective is to identify the point $\\tilde{x} \\sim p(x)$ that, when labeled ($y(\\tilde{x})$), will most effectively decrease the model's variance. The expected error at a given input $x$ is $\\mathbb{E}_{\\hat{y} \\sim p(\\hat{y} | \\mathcal{D}; x), y \\sim p(y|x)} (\\hat{y} - y)^2$. $\\hat{y}$ represents the model's prediction, while $y$ denotes the true label corresponding to the input $x$. This formulation captures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values, providing a measure of the model's accuracy. Utilizing concepts from bias-variance decomposition as outlined in the literature [@bias_variance_orig_paper], we can expand the expected error term. The expansion is given by:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb{E}_{\\hat{y} \\sim p(\\hat{y} | \\mathcal{D}; x), y \\sim p(y|x)} (\\hat{y} - y)^2 &= \\mathbb{E}_{\\hat{y}, y}[(\\hat{y} - \\mathbb{E}[y|x]) + (\\mathbb{E}[y|x] - y)]^2 \\\\\n&= \\mathbb{E}_{\\hat{y}, y} [(y - \\mathbb{E}[y|x])^2]\\\\\n&+ 2\\mathbb{E}_{\\hat{y}, y} [(\\hat{y} - \\mathbb{E}[y|x])(\\mathbb{E}[y|x] - y)]\\\\\n&+ \\mathbb{E}_{\\hat{y}, y}(\\hat{y} - \\mathbb{E}[y|x])^2\n\\end{aligned}$$ {#eq-eq3.17}\n\nIn @eq-eq3.17, the first term represents the variance of the true label $y$, the second term evaluates to zero, and the third term accounts for the variance of the model's prediction $\\hat{y}$. To clarify why the second term is zero, we note that $\\mathbb{E}_{\\hat{y}, y}[\\mathbb{E}[y|x] - y] = 0$. This indicates that the expected deviation of the true label from its conditional mean is null, as $\\mathbb{E}[y|x]$ is, by definition, the average of $y$ given $x$. Focusing on the third term, we derive it as follows:\n\n$$\\mathbb{E}_{\\hat{y}, y}(\\hat{y} - \\mathbb{E}[y|x])^2 = \\mathbb{E}_{\\hat{y}, y}[(\\hat{y} - \\mathbb{E}_{\\hat{y}}[\\hat{y}] + \\mathbb{E}_{\\hat{y}}[\\hat{y}] - \\mathbb{E}[y|x])^2] = \\mathbb{E}_{\\hat{y}, y}[(\\hat{y} - \\mathbb{E}_{\\hat{y}}[\\hat{y}])^2] + (\\mathbb{E}_{\\hat{y}}[\\hat{y}] - \\mathbb{E}[y|x])^2$$\n\nHere, $\\mathbb{E}_{\\hat{y}}[\\hat{y}]$ represents the expected model prediction conditioned on the data $\\mathcal{D}$ and input $x$. Combining the results of our analysis, we arrive at the total expected error as:\n\n$$\\mathbb{E}_{y} [(y - \\mathbb{E}[y|x])^2] + (\\mathbb{E}_{\\hat{y}} [\\hat{y} - \\mathbb{E}[y|x]] )^2 + \\mathbb{E}_{\\hat{y}} [(\\hat{y} - \\mathbb{E}_{\\hat{y}}[\\hat{y}])^2]$$\n\nIn this equation, the first term signifies the variance of the true label, which remains constant for a given $x$. The second term captures the bias of the model, reflecting how much the average model prediction deviates from the expected true label. The third term quantifies the model's uncertainty concerning the selected input $x$. Referring to [@AL_variance], we can denote the uncertainty term as $\\sigma^2_{\\hat{y}} (x | \\mathcal{D}) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\hat{y}} [(\\hat{y} - \\mathbb{E}_{\\hat{y}}[\\hat{y}])^2]$. This term explicitly represents the variance of the model predictions at the input $x$ given the dataset $\\mathcal{D}$. More explicitly, it can be expressed as:\n\n$$\n\\sigma^2_{\\hat{y}} (x | \\mathcal{D}) =  \\mathbb{E}_{\\hat{y} \\sim p(\\hat{y} | \\mathcal{D}; x)} [(\\hat{y} - \\mathbb{E}_{\\hat{y} \\sim p(\\hat{y} | \\mathcal{D}; x)}[\\hat{y}])^2]\n$$ {#eq-eq3.22}\n\nThis formulation emphasizes the variability of the model's predictions around their mean, providing \ninsights into the model's reliability in its estimations. The AL by variance reduction algorithm \ncan be summarized as follows:\n\n1. Sampling Candidates: Sample candidate points $\\tilde{x}_1, \\dots, \\tilde{x}_m$ from $p(x)$.\n2. Compute Expected Variance Reduction: For each candidate $\\tilde{x}_i$, compute $\\mathbb{E}_{p(x)} [\\sigma^2_{\\hat{y}} (x | \\tilde{\\mathcal{D}})]$\n3.  Select the Best Candidate: Choose the point that minimizes expected variance reduction $\\tilde{x}^* = \\arg\\min_{\\tilde{x}_i} \\mathbb{E}_{p(x)} [\\sigma^2_{\\hat{y}} (x | \\tilde{\\mathcal{D}})]$\n4. Update Model: Incorporate the newly labeled data and repeat the process.\n\nWhile there is no general recipe for the number of iterations to perform, one could imagine relying on some empirical measure like a loss on left-out labelled data to gauge model improvement. Intuitively, the size of the data set and its relationship to the loss is intimately tied to the model complexity which impacts its data-thirstiness.We note to the reader that $P(X=x)$ is a distribution with potentially-infinite support and the authors do not compute this integral exactly. Instead, the computational estimate of that integral consists of sampling several points $x \\sim P(X=x)$ and averaging the quantity inside the integral over these points until convergence using Monte-Carlo sampling approaches (see [@monte-carlo]).\n\nArm2D is a kinematics problem where learner has to predict the tip position of a robotic arm given a set of joint angles $\\mathbf{\\theta_1}, \\mathbf{\\theta_2}$. In this analysis, the two models are the Gaussian mixture model and locally-weighted regression (LOESS). The results shown that the variance of the learner decreases because the authors selected points to minimize expected variance. Additionally, we observe a related decrease in the mean square error (MSE) of both models as the dataset size increases. This is a notable outcome because the expected learner variance for these models can be computed accurately and efficiently relative to a new point. When integrated into the general AL loop, this significantly enhances model performance. In the case of the locally-weighted regression model ([@fig-empirical:regress]), it is surprising that if points were chosen randomly, the MSE would be highly unstable, with sharp fluctuations. However, when AL by variance reduction is applied, using expected learner variance as a proxy, the MSE decreases almost smoothly, aside from some initial instabilities.\n\nIndividual comparisons yield a complete ranking over a set of $n$ objects $\\Theta = (\\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\cdots, \\theta_n)$. This ranking is defined as a mapping $\\sigma : \\{1, \\cdots, n\\} \\rightarrow \\{1,\\cdots, n\\}$ that orders the set of objects $\\Theta$. Specifically, for a single $\\sigma$, $\\sigma(\\Theta) = \\theta_{\\sigma(1)} < \\theta_{\\sigma(2)} < \\cdots < \\theta_{\\sigma(n-1)} < \\theta_{\\sigma(n)}$, where $\\theta_{i} < \\theta_{j}$ means that $\\theta_{i}$ is rated lower than $\\theta_{j}$.\n\nFor any $n$ elements to be ranked, there are $n!$ possible orderings that can result in the correct complete ranking. Given that a lower bound on sorting is $n\\log n$, obtaining a guaranteed true rating over $n$ objects requires $n\\log n$ pairwise comparisons if those comparisons are chosen at random. This number can be quite high and costly in many applications, especially since most ranking information comes from humans. The more comparisons they have to make, the more money and time is spent. This process can also be inefficient, as some comparisons provide more value to the learning process than others, making some comparisons a waste. This inefficiency can be detrimental in fields like psychology and market research, where comparisons are heavily utilized, and a faster process could offer significant benefits.\n\nThe reason the lower bound on the number of comparisons is $n\\log n$ is that it assumes no prior information about the underlying space and field, so comparisons are chosen at random. However, leveraging the structures within the comparison space can provide more information about which comparisons are most valuable. For example, [@geo_paper] discusses how eye doctors have a wide range of options when assigning prescriptions for glasses, yet patients do not see them making many comparisons before deciding on the best option. This is because eye doctors incorporate domain knowledge into the process and only ask clients for comparisons when necessary. Applying similar knowledge in the ranking field leads to an AL approach that selects data based on the relevance of a comparison query toward finding the final $\\sigma(\\Theta)$.\n\nWe will review the paper [@geo_paper], which explores AL within data that can be embedded in a multi-dimensional space. In this context, comparisons between two different objects divide the space into halves, with one object being superior in each half. By leveraging such spatial information, the paper develops a geometric approach to ranking and AL. This spatial information serves as the domain knowledge that informs which comparisons to perform to achieve the ranking.\n\nFor this application, the following terms are defined:\n\n1. $R^d$: The space in which objects can be embedded.\n\n2. $\\theta_1, \\cdots,\\theta_n$: The objects, now representing their locations in $R^d$.\n\n3. For each ranking $\\sigma$, there is a reference point $r_{\\sigma} \\in R^d$, such that if, according to ranking $\\sigma$, $\\theta_{i} < \\theta_{j}$ (object $i$ is worse than $j$), then $||\\theta_i - r_{\\sigma}|| < ||\\theta_j - r_{\\sigma}||$. In other words, object $i$ is closer to the reference point $r_{\\sigma}$ of the ranking than object $j$.\n\n4. $\\Sigma_{n,d}$: The set of all possible rankings of the $n$ objects that satisfy the embedding distances in the space $R^d$ as defined above. Note that not all possible rankings will satisfy the embedding conditions, but multiple rankings might satisfy all those conditions.\n\n5. For every ranking $\\sigma$, there is $M_n(\\sigma)$, the number of pairwise comparisons needed to identify the ranking. When comparisons are done at random, $E[M_n(\\sigma)] = n\\log n$. The paper [@geo_paper] examines this quantity to demonstrate that it can be reduced by incorporating spatial knowledge.\n\n6. $q_{i,j}$: The query of comparison between objects $i$ and $j$.\n\nTo properly understand how to select the most valuable queries, it is essential to examine the space where the objects exist and how the queries divide that space to determine the proper rankings. For this example, the paper [@geo_paper] operates in $R^2$ space with three objects: $\\theta_1$, $\\theta_2$, and $\\theta_3$. There are pairwise queries $q_{1,3}$, $q_{2,3}$, and $q_{1,2}$ between them, denoted by solid lines equidistant from the two objects they compare. These lines split the $R^2$ space into halves, with each half closer to one of the two objects. The paper colors the side of the worse object for each query in dark grey and takes the intersection of these halves, resulting in the dark grey region in the image. This region indicates $\\Sigma_{n,2}$ since all points follow the embedding conditions. Specifically, for every point $r$ in the dark grey area, $||\\theta_3 - r|| < ||\\theta_2 - r|| < ||\\theta_1 - r||$, meaning $\\theta_3 < \\theta_2 < \\theta_1$. Thus, every point $r$ is one of the $r_\\sigma$ representing their respective rankings $\\sigma \\in \\Sigma_{n,2}$. In other words, the paper aims to have the reference points and dark grey region closest to the worst object and furthest from the best object.\n\nThe authors also denote the label for each query $q_{i,j}$, such as label $y_{i,j} = 1\\{q_{i,j}\\}$ (for example, $y_{1,2} = 0, y_{3,2} = 1$). This allows for deciding how to label new queries represented by dashed and dotted lines, depending on which objects each query compares. Focusing on the dotted line, called $q_{i,4}$, where $i={1,2,3}$, and considering potential locations of $\\theta_4$, the line must be equidistant from one of the three objects in the picture and $\\theta_4$, meaning $\\theta_4$ can be placed in three different locations. If the query performed is $q_{2,4}$, then $\\theta_4$ will be closer to the dark grey area than $\\theta_2$, thus $y_{2,4} = 0$. However, if $q_{1,4}$ or $q_{3,4}$ are performed, $\\theta_4$ will be further from the dark grey area than $\\theta_1$ or $\\theta_3$, meaning $y_{1,4} = y_{3,4} = 1$. In this case, the labels are contradictory and depend on which object they are compared with, making such a query $q_{i,4}$ ambiguous.\n\nIn contrast, the authors analyze the dashed line, called $q_{i,5}$, where $i={1,2,3}$, and consider potential locations of $\\theta_5$. Since the line must be equidistant from one of the three objects in the picture and $\\theta_5$, it can be placed in three different locations. If one of the three potential queries is performed, $\\theta_5$ will be closer to the dark grey area than $\\theta_1$, $\\theta_2$, and $\\theta_3$, meaning $y_{1,5} = y_{2,5} = y_{3,5} = 0$. In this case, all labels are the same regardless of which object is used, meaning such a query will not be contradictory, as all agree on the label. The goal is to perform as many ambiguous queries as possible and skip non-ambiguous queries to decrease the total $M_n(\\sigma)$. Intuitively, if there is contradictory information about a query, it needs to be erformed so that a human can clarify its direction. Conversely, if all sources of information from the domain space agree on the query's label, that information can be used without asking a human, incorporating the knowledge of the embedding distances. Lastly, to consider the general case of the $R^d$ space, rather than discussing halves of the image, it is essential to discuss half-spaces. Similarly, consider the half-space that assigns a label of $1$ to the query and the half-space assigning a label of $0$. If both half-spaces exist, they have conflicting information on the query, making the query ambiguous. However, if one of the half-spaces does not exist, it means the other is the full space, representing consistency in the label assignment and a non-ambiguous query.\n\nAlgorithms for Ambiguous Query Selection:\n\n```pseudocode\n#| label: alg-qsa\n\\begin{algorithm}\n    \\caption{Query Selection Algorithm}\n    \\begin{algorithmic}\n        \\State \\textbf{input:} $n$ objects in $\\mathbb{R}^d$\n        \\State \\textbf{initialize:} objects $\\theta_1, \\dots, \\theta_n$ in uniformly random order\n        \\For{$j=2, \\dots, n$}\n            \\For{$i=1, \\dots, j-1$}\n                \\If{$q_{i,j}$ is ambiguous}\n                    \\State request $q_{i,j}$'s label from reference\n                \\Else\n                    \\State impute $q_{i,j}$'s label from previously labeled queries\n                \\EndIf\n            \\EndFor\n        \\EndFor\n        \\State \\textbf{output:} ranking of $n$ objects\n    \\end{algorithmic}\n\\end{algorithm}\n```\n\nThe standard algorithm in @alg-qsa requests labels for $q_{i,j}$ if those queries \nare ambiguous; otherwise, it infers the information from prior comparisons and their labels.\n\nIt is important to demonstrate that the number of comparisons decreases. Specifically, [@geo_paper] shows that this algorithm has $E[M_n(\\sigma)] = O(d\\log n)$, where $d$ is the dimension of the space and $d < n$, which improves on the $O(n\\log n)$ baseline. The proof can be studied in detail in the paper itself, but at a high level, it starts by reasoning about the probability of a query being ambiguous and a comparison being requested from a human, thus representing $M_n = \\Sigma_{k=1}^{n-1}\\Sigma_{i=1}^k 1\\{Requestq_{i,k+1}\\}$. For that, the authors define $Q(i,j)$, which represents the number of different rankings that exist for $i$ elements in $j$-dimensional space (e.g., $Q(1,d) = 1, Q(n,0) = 1, Q(n,1) = n!$). In that case, $|\\Sigma_{n,d}| = Q(n,d)$. Further, using recurrence relations for $Q(i,j)$, the authors derive that $|\\Sigma_{n,d}| = Q(n,d) = O(n^{2d})$, which is omitted here. Analogously, the authors define $P(i,j)$, which represents the number of rankings in $\\Sigma_{n,d}$ that will still be possible with the addition of a new element $i+1$ to the ranking objects. $P(i,j)$ estimates how much of the dark grey area will still exist after making a query for $i+1$. As indicated there, the dotted line ambiguous query did not change the dark grey a rea at all ($P(n,d) = Q(n,d)$), whereas the dashed non-ambiguous query would cut a piece from it ($P(n,d) < Q(n,d)$). Thus, $Request q_{i,k+1} = P(k,d) / Q(k,d)$, so a higher value indicates more possible rankings and an ambiguous query that needs to be requested to obtain more useful information. With this in mind, the authors derive that $E[M_n(\\sigma)] = O(d\\log n)$, showing that fewer queries are needed for effective ranking.\n\nThe issue with this algorithm is that only one human provides the answers to the requested queries, which means it does not account for their biases. An alternative approach is a Robust Query Selection Algorithm (RQSA) [@geo_paper], which uses majority voting for every query to indicate the ground truth of the query's label. However, the authors consider that a group of people can still give incorrect or divided responses. If the votes for each answer are almost equal in number, the authors push that query to the end of the algorithm to see if it can become a non-ambiguous query with more information learned. If it does not, an odd number of voters is used to determine the final ranking.\n\n##### Performance Analysis {#sec-QSA .unnumbered}\n\n![Mean and standard deviation of requested queries (solid) in the\nnoiseless case for $n = 100$; $\\log_2|\\Sigma_{n,d}|$ is a lower bound\n(dashed).](Figures/Dim:query_graph.png){#fig-rand_n width=\"60%\"}\n\n::: {#tbl-geo_acc}\n  Dimension                           2      3\n  --------------- ----------------- ------ ------\n  \\% of queries         mean         14.5   18.5\n                        std          5.3     6\n  Average error    $d(\\bar{y}, y)$   0.23   0.21\n                   $d(\\bar{y}, y)$   0.31   0.29\n\n  : Statistics for the Robust Query Selection Algorithm (RQSA) [@geo_paper] and the baseline of conducting all comparisons. $y$ serves as a noisy ground truth, $\\tilde{y}$ is the result of all comparisons, and $\\hat{y}$ is the output of the RQSA.\n:::\n\n@fig-rand_n shows that the number of comparisons fits within the expected bounds, as $\\log|\\Sigma_{n,d}| = \\log(n^d) = d\\log n$. To derive that graph, authors [@geo_paper] sampled 100 random data points in a $R^d$ space, where $d$ took on 10 different values as indicated on the graph. Each dimension's experiments were repeated 25 times for consistency.\n\nWith regard to the accuracy and performance of the method, the authors did a ranking experiment on 100 different audio signals, results of which can be seen in @tbl-geo_acc. The ground truth labels came from humans, indicated by $y$ in the table. That resulted in the existence of noise and potential errors in the ground truth, which could influence the performance of both the baseline algorithm that does all comparisons ($\\tilde{y}$) and the Robust Query Selection Algorithm (RQSA) ($\\hat{y}$). As can be seen in both 2 and 3-dimensional spaces RQSA performed worse by $8\\%$ compared to the baseline, which indicates that AL that uses the domain information can still be erroneous due to the inference of certain comparisons that sometimes may not be entirely correct. However, as can be seen by the upper part of @tbl-geo_acc, significantly less queries were requested compared to the baseline, which means that the approach can have a significant benefit at a cost of slight loss in accuracy.\n\n#### User Information as Domain Knowledge for Active Learning {#sec-geo_app .unnumbered}\n\nAn alternative source of domain knowledge could be users themselves, who can indicate their uncertainty when it comes to comparing two objects. Prior studies have shown [@unnoisy_humans] that when presented with only two options when selecting which object is better, but not being able to properly decide, users would get frustrated and tend to respond more faultyly, creating noise and incorrect responses in the data. Through feedback and other studies [@noisy_humans] it was determined that presenting users with an option of indifference between the two objects can remove those problems. Moreover, in connection to AL, the authors show that such an option helps to select more informative queries since it provides more domain knowledge that can be used, resulting in a decrease in the number of queries required. For this problem, the following terms are defined:\n\n1.  $c$ - a cost function that represents user preferences, and the result the model has to determine at the end of training. The preferred items will have lower costs, and less preferred ones will have higher costs. The goal is to determine this function with the fewest possible number of queries using AL.\n\n2.  $H$ - a set of hypotheses over the possible cost functions, where for each $h \\in H$ there is a cost function $c_h$ associated with it.\n\n3.  $h^*$ - a true hypothesis that the model needs to determine, which has cost $c_{h^*}$ associated with it\n\n4.  $t(x,y)$ - a test performed to compare items $x$ and $y$ (the user is being asked to provide a response to which item is better). Those tests result in changes and adjustments to $H$ as more information is learned.\n\n5.  $o(x,y)$ - observation or result of $t(x,y)$, where $o(x,y) \\in \\{x<y, x>y\\}$\n\n6.  $S = \\{(t_1, o_1), (t_2, o_2),...,(t_m, o_m)\\}$ - a sequence of $m$ pairs of tests and observations\n\n7.  $w(H|S)$ - probability mass of all hypotheses that are still consistent with the observations (similar to the dark grey area and $Q(i,j)$). This means that if $h \\in H$ is inconsistent with user responses received, it is removed from $H$.\n\nWith the key terms defined, let's consider the noiseless base setting where users only have two options for response. Those components will also later be translated to the setting with the third option so the true cost function can be determined there. $w(H|S)$ is the sum of the weights of all hypotheses that are still consistent with the evidence: $w(H|S) = \\sum_{h \\in H} w(h | S)$. Each $w(h|S)$ is a probability of the evidence's existence given such hypothesis: $w(h|S) = p(S|h)$. Such probability comes from the test-observation pairs since they compose the set $S$. Moreover, each test is independent of other tests, which gives $p(S|h) = \\prod_{(t,o) \\in S} p((t,o) | h)$. In the noiseless setting, users will select an option that minimizes their cost function (selecting more preferred items), mathematically defined as:\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n    p((t, o = x) | h) = \n    \\begin{cases}\n        1 & c_h(x) < c_h(y)\\\\\n        0 & else\n    \\end{cases}\n\\end{aligned}$$ {#eq-prob_base}\n\nAs has been discussed, users are not perfect evaluators and even get frustrated if unable to select the better option. Prior work [@unnoisy_humans] has shown that treating users as perfect can lead to poor performance. That gave rise to accounting for noise in users' responses, but a majority of such work applies the same noise to all queries and all responses. While those led to great performance results [@noisy_humans], they don't accurately reflect the real world, which gave rise to the idea of creating query-based noise. Effectively, for some of the queries it is important to incorporate the fact that the user is unsure and noisy, but for others, if the user is confident, noise in the response is not needed at all. For comparison-based learning, this means that the noise is related to the costs of the two items compared. Specifically for items $x$ and $y$, if $c_{h^*}(x) \\simeq c_{h^*}(y)$ then the items are hard to distinguish for the user, so here it is preferred to incorporate user uncertainty and noise. But if $c_{h^*}(x) >> c_{h^*}(y)$, the user will certainly select $y$ and the other way around, which is where the noise is not needed. Query-dependent noise is also supported in the psychology literature, which means that such an approach is more related to the real world. In particular, psychologists talk about the Luce-Sheppard Choice rule [@lus-shep] when talking about comparisons. This rule previously gave rise to a logistic model based on the noise [@lus-log] where the probability of observation for a given test is $p((t, o = x) | h) \\propto exp(-\\gamma * c_h(x))$\n\n![User response model in the noiseless setting](Figures/Noiseless probs.png){#fig-noiseless_1 width=\"100%\"}\n\n![User response with Luce Sheppard noise model](Figures/Noise probs.png){#fig-noiseless_2 width=\"100%\"}\n\n[@fig-noiseless_1; @fig-noiseless_2] demonstrate the difference between the noiseless setting and incorporating the Luce-Sheppard Choice rule. GBS is the baseline model with only 2 response options, and CLAUS is the model with the uncertainty option added. The figures show how incorporating such noise influences and smoothes the probability distribution of the user's response.\n\nWe will now discuss the functionality of CLAUS, which is an algorithm designed by [@claus] that allows users to select an uncertain response about the two options that they need to rank. The authors model such uncertainty as $\\epsilon$ and it is associated with each $c_h$, so now every hypothesis $h$ is defined over a pair of $(c_h, \\epsilon_h)$. It is important to note that the goal is to still learn and maintain our objective on $c$, $\\epsilon$ is only necessary to model the users' responses. The uncertainty relates to the cost function as $|c_h(x) - c_h(y)| < \\epsilon_h$. This means that the user is uncertain between items $x$ and $y$ and their cost difference is negligible such that the user is not able to select which item is better. This in turn gives more information about the real value of the two items, as a binary response would indicate the user's preference towards one item, which will not be real and will skew the cost functions. This causes modifications of the problem set-up:\n\n1.  For test $t(x,y)$ the observation will be $o(x,y) \\in \\{x<y, x>y, \\tilde{xy}\\}$, where $\\tilde{xy}$ is the uncertain response.\n\n2.  The probability distribution over the user's response ([@eq-prob_base]) will now be defined as:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n    p((t, o = x) | h) = \n    \\begin{cases}\n        1 & c_h(x) < c_h(y) - \\epsilon_h\\\\\n        0 & else\n    \\end{cases}\n\\end{aligned}$$ {#eq-eq3.31}\n    \n$$\\begin{aligned}\n    p((t, o = \\tilde{xy}) | h) = \n    \\begin{cases}\n        1 & |c_h(x) - c_h(y)|^2 < \\epsilon_h^2\\\\\n        0 & else\n    \\end{cases}\n\\end{aligned}$$ {#eq-eq3.32}\n\nThis means the user confidently selects $x$ when it is better than $y$ by more than $\\epsilon$, but if the squared difference of the cost functions of two items is negligible by $\\epsilon$ user will choose the indifferent option.\n\n3.  Finally this also updates the noise model:\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n    &p((t, o = x) | h) \\propto \\exp(-\\gamma * [c_h(x) - c_h(y)]) \\\\\n    &p((t, o = \\tilde{xy}) | h) \\propto exp(-1/\\epsilon_h^2 * [c_h(x) - c_h(y)]^2)\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nBefore diving deeper into the comparisons of performance, it is important to indicate that rather than predicting a specific pair $(c_h, \\epsilon_h)$, the algorithm focuses on predicting a group of pairs that are similar to one another, otherwise called equivalence class (@fig-equiv_c), which indicates not essentially different hypothesis for the cost function and uncertainty. That information is learned through each new test, as the algorithm updates the information about $c$ and $\\epsilon$ that distinguishes between the distinct $h$, finding the equivalence groups among them. Moreover, the authors tweaked the parameter responsible for the size of the equivalence class (how many hypotheses can be grouped together at a time).\n\n::: {#tbl-claus_tab}\n  Category                        Accuracy                       Query Count\n  --------------------- ------------------------------------ ------------------------------------\n  GBS - About Equal               $94.15 \\pm 0.52$                     $36.02 \\pm 0.03$\n  GBS - Not Sure         $\\textbf{94.66} \\pm \\textbf{0.55}$            $35.95 \\pm 0.04$\n  CLAUS - About Equal             $91.56 \\pm 0.84$            $\\textbf{25.93} \\pm \\textbf{0.41}$\n  CLAUS - Not Sure                $90.86 \\pm 0.74$                     $26.98 \\pm 0.47$\n\n  : Performance of GBS and CLAUS with different labels for the uncertainty\n:::\n\nThe first performance evaluation is done on the number of queries and confirms that it decreases. The GBS model serves as the baseline, as it will do all of the comparison queries using the binary response options. The CLAUS model is measured over different values of $\\epsilon$ on the x-axis and over different sizes of the equivalence sets indicated by different shades of blue. Figure shows that all variants of CLAUS use approximately 10 fewer queries on average compared to GBS. Moreover, using bigger-sized equivalence classes can further decrease the number of needed queries. The most optimal $\\epsilon \\simeq 0.07$, after which higher $\\epsilon$ does not provide any benefit.\n\nLastly, the authors considered the performance difference, which is indicated in @tbl-claus_tab. For that authors used two different labels for the uncertainty button in CLAUS, it was either labeled as \"About Equal\" or \"Not Sure\" as those can provoke different responses and feelings in users. Moreover, GBS and CLAUS-type responses were mixed in the same set of questions to the user, which splits the metrics for both in two as can be seen in @tbl-claus_tab. The performance of CLAUS is lower by $3\\%$ on average, showing that a smaller number of queries can still lead to a performance loss. However, the second column of @tbl-claus_tab supports the information, as it also shows that 10 fewer queries were conducted on average.\n\n### Active Preference-Based Learning of Reward Functions\n\nAL can be essential in learning within dynamic systems and environments. Say we have an agent in an environment, and we want it to conform to a certain behavior as set by a human. How exactly do we go about doing this? In a traditional RL setting, this is solved by a class of algorithms under Inverse Reinforcement Learning. Techniques such as VICE and GAIL attempt to learn a reward function that can distinguish between states visited by the agent and states desired to be visited as defined by a human. In effect, a human will demonstrate what it would like the agent to do in the environment, and from there, learning is done. However, what if humans do not precisely know how an agent should optimally behave in an environment but still have some opinion on what trajectories would be better than others? This is where a paper like Active Preference-Based Learning of Reward Functions comes into the picture. The paper aims to use human preferences to aid an agent's learning within a dynamic system.\n\nA dynamic system contains human input, robotic input, and an environment state. The transitions between states is defined by $f_{HR}$, so that we have: \n$$x^{t+1} = f_{HR}(x^t, u_R, u_H)$$  {#eq-eq3.35}\nAt a given time step $t$, we have $x_t$, $u_R^t$, and $u_H^t$. This can be encapsulated into a single $d$ dimensional feature vector that the authors denote as $\\phi$. The paper then assumes that the underlying reward model we are trying to learn can be represented linearly. If we have our human reward preference function defined as $r_H$, this means we can write $r_H$ as: $$r_H(x^t, u_R^t, u_H^t) = w^{\\intercal}\\phi(x^t, u_R^t, u_H^t)$$ {#eq-eq3.35} Because the reward function is linear, we can take the weight vector out of the summation if we want to calculate the reward over an entire trajectory: \n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nR_{H}(x^0, u_R, u_H) &= \\sum_{t=0}^{N} r_{H}(x^t, u^t, u_H^t)\\\\\n\\Phi &= \\sum \\phi(x^t, u_R^t, u_H^t)\\\\ \nR_H(traj) &= w\\cdot\\Phi(traj)\n\\end{aligned}$$ {#eq-eq3.36}\n\nFirst, the scale of $w$ does not matter because we only care about the relative rewards produced with $w$ (given two different trajectories, we want to answer the question of which trajectory a human would prefer, i.e. which one has a higher preference reward). This means we can constrain $||w|| <= 1$, so the initial prior is uniform over a unit ball. From here, we can determine a probabilistic expression to assess whether we should prefer trajectory A or B (because it can be noisy with human input). Let $I_t = +1$ if the human prefers trajectory $A$ and let $I_t = -1$ if the human prefers trajectory $B$. We get the following for $p(I_t | w)$.\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\np(I_t = +1|w) &= \\frac{exp(R_H(traj_A))}{exp(R_H(traj_A)) + exp(R_H(traj_B))}\\\\\np(I_t = -1|w) &= \\frac{exp(R_H(traj_B))}{exp(R_H(traj_A)) + exp(R_H(traj_B))}\n\\end{aligned}$$ {#eq-eq3.37}\n\nWe can re-write this expression to make it cleaner: $\\psi = \\Phi(traj_a) - \\Phi(traj_b), f_{\\psi} (w) = p(I_t|w) = \\frac{1}{1 + exp(-I_tw^{\\intercal}\\psi)}$. The idea now is that we can update $p(w)$ everytime we get a result from a human preference query using Bayes: $p(w|I_t) <- p(w) \\cdot p(I_t|w)$. We do not need to know $p(I_t)$ because we can use an algorithm like the Metropolis algorithm to actually sample.\n\nHow do we actually generate queries for the user to pick between? This paper synthetically generates queries through an optimization process and then presents them to a human to pick between. The idea is that we want to generate a query that maximizes the conditional entropy $H(I|w)$. There are a few ways to think about this -- intuitively we want to pick a query that we are most uncertain about given our current weights (thus having the highest conditional entropy given the weights). The way the authors of the paper frame this originally in the paper is that \"we want to find the next query such that it will help us remove as much volume (the integral of the unnormalized pdf over w) as possible from the space of possible rewards.\" Mathematically this can be written as:\n\n$$max_{x^0, u_R, u_H^A, u_H^B} min\\{E[1-f_{\\psi}(w)], E[1 - f_{-\\psi}(w)]\\}$$ {#eq-eq3.41}\n\nBut how exactly do we optimize this expression mathematically? After all, we need to use this expression to generate synthetic queries. The answer is to sample $w_1, ... w_m$ from $p(w)$. We can assume we are sampling points from a point cloud, thus approximating the distribution $p(w)$ as $p(w) = \\frac{1}{M} \\sum \\delta (w_i).$ We can now approximate the expectation expression as $E[1 - f_{\\psi}(w)] = \\frac{1}{M} (\\sum 1 - f_{\\psi}(w_i))$, and now we can optimize the expression to generate a synthetic query!\nAltogether, the algorithm looks like the following:\n\n```pseudocode\n#| label: alg-design\n\\begin{algorithm}\n\\caption{Preference-Based Learning of Reward Functions}\n\\begin{algorithmic}\n    \\State \\textbf{input:} features $\\phi$, horizon $N$, dynamics $f$, $iter$\n    \\State \\textbf{initialize:} $p(w) \\sim Uniform(B)$, for a unit ball $B$\n    \\While{$t < iter$}\n        \\State $W \\gets M$ samples from $AdaptiveMetropolis(p(w))$\n        \\State $(x^0, u_R, u^A_H, u^B_H) \\gets SynthExps(W,f)$\n        \\State $I_t \\gets QueryHuman(x^0, u_R, u^A_H, u^B_H)$\n        \\State $\\varphi = \\Phi(x^0, u_R, u^A_H) - \\Phi(x^0, u_R, u^B_H)$\n        \\State $f_\\varphi(w) = \\min(1, I_t\\exp(w^\\top \\varphi))$\n        \\State $p(w) \\gets p(w) \\cdot f_\\varphi(w)$\n        \\State $t \\gets t+1$\n    \\EndWhile\n    \\State \\textbf{output:} distribution of $w: p(w)$\n\\end{algorithmic}\n\\end{algorithm}\n```\n\nThe algorithm itself works well, however there ends up being a bottle neck that each query needs to be synthesized before being sent to the human -- one at a time. In other words, the human gives their feedback, waits for a query to be synthesized, and then gives another data point of feedback. There is no room for parallelization and so the authors proposed a second algorithm in a separate paper that allows for the batching of queries. Simply put, we change the mathematical expression to the following:\n\n$$max_{\\xi_{ib+1_A}, \\xi_{ib+1_B}, ... , \\xi_{ib+b_A}, \\xi_{ib+b_B} H(I_{ib+1}, I_{ib+2}, .., I_{ib+b} | w)}$$ {#eq-eq3.44}\n\nNaively, we could consider optimizing this in the greedy fashion. This would mean just synthetically generating $b$ independent queries. The obvious drawback of this method would be that the queries would likely be very similar to each other. The authors propose a few other heuristics that would help guide the algorithm away from generating very similar queries. As an example, the authors propose Medioid Selection where we have to cluster $B$ greedy vectors into $b < B$ groups and pick one vector from each group (the medioid). The authors also propose two other methods rooted in providing different queries: boundary medioids selection and successive elimination. They are best visually depicted as:\n\n![Different selection strategies](Figures/greedy.png){#fig-selection-strategy width=\"75%\"}\n\nThe authors test both the non-batched and variety of batched learning\nalgorithms on multiple environments:\n\n![Comparison between batched and non-batched algorithms](Figures/activeresults.png){#fig-batch-nonbatch width=\"75%\"}\n\nWhat is interesting to note is that when graphed over $N$ the non-batched AL approach does in the same ball-park of performance as the batched approaches. However, if you graph it over time, we see that learning is a much slower process when not-batched.\n\n## Case Study 1: Foundation Models for Robotics\n\nModern foundation models have been ubiquitous in discussions of powerful, general purpose AI systems that can accomplish myriad tasks across many disciplines such as programming, medicine, law, open question-answering and much more, with rapidly increasing capabilities [@bommasani2022opportunities]. However, despite successes from large labs in controlled environments [@brohan2023rt2] foundation models have not seen ubiquitous use in robotics due to shifting robot morphology, lack of data, and the sim to real gap in robotics [@walke2023bridgedata]. For this subsection we explore two promising approaches known as R3M and Voltron which are the first to leverage pre-training on vast amounts of data towards performance improvement on downstream robotic tasks despite the aforementioned issues [@nair2022r3m; @karamcheti2023languagedriven].\n\nR3M represents a significant advancement in the field of robotic manipulation and learning. This model diverges from traditional approaches that rely on training from scratch within the same domain on the same robot data as instead it leverags pretraining on large datasets, akin to the practices in computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) where models are trained on diverse, large-scale datasets to create reusable, general-purpose representations. The core principle behind R3M is its training methodology. It is pre-trained on a wide array of human videos, encompassing various activities and interactions. This diverse dataset enables the model to capture a broad spectrum of physical interactions and dynamics, which are crucial for effective robotic manipulation known as EGO4D [@grauman2022ego4d]. However, prior papers could not fit this dataset well, and R3M leveraged. The training utilizes a unique objective that combines time contrastive learning, video-language alignment, and a sparsity penalty. This objective ensures that R3M not only understands the temporal dynamics of scenes (i.e., how states transition over time) but also focuses on semantically relevant features, such as objects and their interrelations, while maintaining a compact and efficient representation. What sets R3M apart in the realm of robotics is its efficiency and effectiveness in learning from a limited amount of data. The model demonstrates remarkable performance in learning tasks in the real world with minimal human supervision -- typically less than 10 minutes. This is a stark contrast to traditional models that require extensive and often prohibitively large datasets for training. Furthermore, R3M's pre-trained nature allows for its application across a variety of tasks and environments without the need for retraining from scratch, making it a versatile tool in robotic manipulation. The empirical results from using R3M are compelling, leading to a 10% improvement over training from a pretrained image-net model, self-supervised approaches such as MoCo or even CLIP [@deng2009imagenet; @he2020momentum; @radford2021learning]. Note however, that R3m does not use any language data which leaves quite a bit of supervision to be desired.\n\nBuilding off the success of R3M, Voltron proposes a further extension of leveraging self-supervision and advancements in foundation models, and multi-modality. Voltron takes on an intuitive and simple dual use objective, where the trained model alternates between predicting the task in an image through natural language and classifying images based on a natural text label. This forces a nuanced understanding of both modalities [@radford2021learning]. Voltron's approach is distinguished by its versatility and depth of learning. It is adept at handling a wide range of robotic tasks, from low-level spatial feature recognition to high-level semantic understanding required in language-conditioned imitation and intent scoring. This flexibility makes it suitable for various applications in robotic manipulation, from grasping objects based on descriptive language to performing complex sequences of actions in response to verbal instructions. The authors rigorously test Voltron in scenarios such as dense segmentation for grasp affordance prediction, object detection in cluttered scenes, and learning multi-task language-conditioned policies for real-world manipulation with up to 15% improvement over baselines. In each of these domains, Voltron has shown a remarkable ability to outperform existing models like MVP and R3M, showcasing its superior adaptability and learning capabilities [@xiao2022masked]. Moreover, Voltron's framework allows for a balance between encoding low-level and high-level features, which is critical in the context of robotics. This balance enables the model to excel in both control tasks and those requiring deeper semantic understanding, offering a comprehensive solution in the realm of robotic vision and manipulation.\n\nVoltron stands as a groundbreaking approach in the field of robotics, offering a language-driven, versatile, and efficient approach to learning and manipulation. Its ability to seamlessly integrate visual and linguistic data makes it a potent tool in the ever-evolving landscape of robotic technology, with potential applications that extend far beyond current capabilities. Interesting the authors show Voltron does not beat R3M off the shelf but only when trained on similar amounts of data. Nevertheless, Voltron's success in diverse tasks and environments heralds a new era in robotic manipulation, where language and vision coalesce to create more intelligent, adaptable, and capable robotic systems.\n\nOn the note of applying AL to RL and environment settings, there have been many recent papers that have attempted to extend this to more modern RL environments. For example, the paper \"When to Ask for Help\" [@ask_help] examines the intersection of autonomous and AL. Instead of just expecting an RL agent to autonomously solve a task, making the assumption that an agent could get stuck and need human input to get \"unstuck\" is a key insight of the paper. In general, there has been an emphasis in recent literature in robotics on not just blindly using demonstration data as a form of human input, but rather actively querying a human and using this to better synthesize correct actions.\n\nAL holds promise for enhancing AI models in real-world scenarios, yet several challenges persist. This discussion aims to provide an overview of these challenges.\n\nTask-Specific Considerations: For certain tasks, the input space of a model may have some rare yet extremely important pockets which may never be discovered by AL and may cause severe blindspots in the model. In medical imaging for instance, there can be rare yet critical diseases. Designing AL strategies for medical image analysis must prioritize rare classes, such as various forms of cancers. Oftentimes, collecting data around those rare classes is not a recommendation of the AL process because these examples constitute heavy distribution drifts from the input distribution a model has seen.\n\nComplex Task Adaptation: AL has predominantly been adopted for simple classification tasks, leaving more other types of tasks (generative ones for instance), less explored. In Natural Language Processing, tasks like natural language inference, question-answering pose additional complexities that affect the direct application of the AL process. While machine translation has seen AL applications, generation tasks in NLP require more thorough exploration. Challenges arise in obtaining unlabeled data, particularly for tasks with intricate inputs.\n\nUnsupervised and Semi-Supervised Approaches: In the presence of large datasets without sufficient labels, unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches become crucial. These methods offer a means to extract information without relying on labeled data for every data point, potentially revolutionizing fields like medical image analysis. There is an ongoing need for methods that combine self/semi-supervised learning with AL.\n\nAlgorithm Scalability: Scalability is a critical concern for online AL algorithms, particularly when dealing with large datasets and high-velocity data streams. The computational demands of AL can become prohibitive as data volume increases, posing challenges for practical deployment. Issues of catastrophic forgetting and model plasticity further complicate scalability, requiring careful consideration in algorithm design.\n\nLabeling Quality Assurance: The effectiveness of most online AL strategies hinges on the quality of labeled data. Ensuring labeling accuracy in real-world scenarios is challenging, with human annotators prone to errors, biases, and diverse interpretations. Addressing imperfections in labeling through considerations of oracle imperfections becomes essential in real-life AL applications. Solutions for cleaning up data and verifying its quality need to be more aggressively pursued.\n\nData Drift Challenges: Real-world settings introduce data drift, where distributions shift over time, challenging models to adapt for accurate predictions. These shifts can impact the quality of labeled data acquired in the AL process. For example, the criterion or proxy used for selecting informative instances may be thrown off when the distribution a model is trained on, and the distribution we want it to perform well on, are too far away from one another.\n\nEvaluation in Real-Life Scenarios: While AL methods are often evaluated assuming access to ground-truth labels, the real motivation for AL lies in label scarcity. Assessing the effectiveness of AL strategies becomes challenging in real-life scenarios where ground-truth labels may be limited. In other words, one may verify the goodness of an AL algorithm within the lab, but once the algorithm is deployed for improving all sorts of models on all sorts of data distributions, verifying whether AL is actually improving a model is tricky, especially when collecting and labeling data from the target distribution is expensive and defeats the purpose of using AL in the first place.\n\nBy systematically addressing these challenges, the field of AL in AI can progress towards more effective and practical applications. In summary, AL is a promising modern tool to model training that presents potential benefits. As was mentioned at the start, there are numerous approaches that can be employed by AL, starting from reducing error of model's prediction, reducing variance, to more conformal predictions. The flavor of AL heavily depends on the applications, which include robotics, LLM, autonomous vehicles, and more. We discussed in more detail how to perform AL for variance reduction in the case of predicting kinematics of the robotic arms, which showed decrease in MSE as well as more stable reduction in it. Next we talked about using AL for reducing the number of comparisons required to create a ranking of objects, and the examples discussed were able to achieve that but with some loss in the prediction accuracy. Finally, we discussed how AL can be used for modeling of reward functions within a dynamical system, which demonstrated improvements in performance and time required to achieve it. For a more hands-on experience with AL and demonstrated example, we encourage the readers to explore a blogpost by Max Halford [@max_halford].\n\n## Case Study 2: Performance Metric Elicitation {#sec-metric-elicitation}\n\nIn binary classification problems, selecting an appropriate performance metric that aligns with the real-world task is crucial. The problem of *metric elicitation* aims to characterize and discover the performance metric of a practitioner, reflecting the rewards or costs associated with correct or incorrect classification. For instance, in medical contexts such as diagnosing a disease or determining the appropriateness of a treatment, trade-offs are made for incorrect decisions. Not administering a treatment could lead to the worsening of a disease (a false negative), whereas delivering the wrong treatment could cause adverse side effects worse than not treating the condition (a false positive). Rather than choosing from a limited set of default choices like the F1-score or weighted accuracy, metric elicitation considers the process of devising a metric that best matches the preferences of practitioners or users. This is achieved by querying an \"oracle\" who provides feedback on proposed potential metrics through pairwise comparisons. Since queries to humans are often expensive, the goal is to minimize the number of comparisons needed.\n\nThe motivation for the pairwise comparison aspect of metric elicitation [@pmlr-v89-hiranandani19a] stems from a rich history of literature in psychology, economics, and computer science [@pref1; @pref2; @pref3; @pref4; @ab], demonstrating that humans are often ineffective at providing absolute feedback on aspects such as potential prices, user interfaces, or even ML model outputs (hence the comparison-based structure of RLHF, for instance). Additionally, confusion matrices accurately capture binary metrics such as accuracy, $F_\\beta$, and Jaccard similarity by recording the number of false positives, true positives, false negatives, and true negatives obtained by a classifier. The main goal of this chapter is to introduce two binary-search procedures that can approximate the oracle's performance metric for two types of metrics (linear and linear-fractional performance metrics) by presenting the oracle with confusion matrices generated by various classifiers. Essentially, we are learning an optimal threshold for classification given a decision boundary for a binary classification problem.\n\nFirst, we introduce some relevant notation that will later be used to formalize notions of oracle queries, classifiers, and metrics. In this context, $X \\in \\mathcal{X}$ represents an input random variable, while $Y \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ denotes the output random variable. We learn from a dataset of size $n$, denoted by $\\{(x, y)_i\\}^n_{i=1}$, which is generated independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) from some distribution $\\mathbb{P}(X, Y)$. The conditional probability of the positive class, given some sample $x$, is denoted by $\\eta(\\vec{x}) = \\mathbb{P}(Y=1 | X=x)$. The marginal probability of the positive class is represented by $\\zeta = \\mathbb{P}(Y=1)$. \n\nThe set of all potential classifiers is $\\mathcal{H} = \\{h : \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}\\}$. The confusion \nmatrix for a classifier $h$ is $C(h, \\mathbb{P}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2 \\times 2}$, where $C_{ij}(h, \\mathbb{P}) = \\mathbb{P}(Y=i, h=j)$ \nfor $i, j \\in \\{0,1\\}$. These entries represent the false positives, true positives, false negatives, and true negatives, \nensuring that $\\sum_{i,j}C_{ij}=1$. The set of all confusion matrices is denoted by $\\mathcal{C}$. Since \n$FN(h, \\mathbb{P}) = \\zeta - TP(h, \\mathbb{P})$ and $FP(h, \\mathbb{P}) = 1 - \\zeta - TN(h, \\mathbb{P})$, $\\mathcal{C}$ \nis actually a 2-dimensional space, not a 4-dimensional space.\n\nAny hyperplane in the $(tp, tn)$ space is given by $\\ell := a \\cdot tp + b \\cdot tn = c$, where $a, b, c \\in \\mathbb{R}$. \nGiven a classifier $h$, we define a performance metric $\\phi : [0, 1]^{2 \\times 2} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. The value \n$\\phi(C(h))$, which represents the performance of a classifier with respect to a certain metric, is referred to as the \n*utility* of the classifier $h$. We assume, without loss of generality, that a higher value of $\\phi$ indicates a better \nperformance metric for $h$. Our focus is to recover some metric $\\phi$ using comparisons between confusion matrices $C(h)$, \ndetermined by classifiers $h$, which approximates the oracle's \"ground-truth\" metric $\\phi^*$.\n\nNext, we introduce two classes of performance metrics—*Linear Performance Metrics (LPM)* and *Linear-Fractional \nPerformance Metrics (LFPM)*—for which we will present two elicitation algorithms. \n\nAn *LPM*, given constants $\\{a_{11}, a_{01}, a_{10}, a_{00}\\} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{4}$, is defined as:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\phi(C) &= a_{11} TP + a_{01} FP + a_{10} FN + a_{00} TN\\\\\n&= m_{11} TP + m_{00} TN + m_{0},\n\\end{aligned}$$ {#eq-eqlpm}\n\nwhere $m_{11} = (a_{11} - a_{10})$, $m_{00} = (a_{00} - a_{01})$, and $m_{0} = a_{10} \\zeta + a_{01} (1 - \\zeta)$. \nThis reparametrization simplifies the metric by reducing dimensionality, making it more tractable for elicitation. \nOne example of an LPM is *weighted accuracy*, defined as $WA = w_1TP + w_2TN$, where adjusting $w_1$ and $w_2$ controls \nthe relative importance of different types of misclassification.\n\nAn *LFPM*, defined by constants $\\{a_{11}, a_{01}, a_{10}, a_{00}, b_{11}, b_{01}, b_{10}, b_{00}\\} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{8}$, is given by:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\phi(C) &= \\frac{a_{11} TP + a_{01} FP + a_{10} FN + a_{00} TN}{b_{11} TP + b_{01} FP + b_{10} FN + b_{00} TN}\\\\\n&= \\frac{p_{11} TP + p_{00} TN + p_{0}}{q_{11} TP + q_{00} TN + q_{0}},\n\\end{aligned}$$ {#eq-eqlfpm}\n\nwhere $p_{11} = (a_{11} - a_{10})$, $p_{00} = (a_{00} - a_{01})$, $q_{11} = (b_{11} - b_{10})$, $q_{00} = (b_{00} - b_{01})$, \n$p_{0} = a_{10} \\zeta + a_{01} (1 - \\zeta)$, and $q_{0} = b_{10} \\zeta + b_{01} (1 - \\zeta)$. This parametrization also \nsimplifies the elicitation process by reducing the number of variables. Common LFPMs include the $F_\\beta$ score and Jaccard \nsimilarity, defined as:\n\n$$F_{\\beta} = \\frac{TP}{\\frac{TP}{1+\\beta^{2}} - \\frac{TN}{1+\\beta^{2}} + \\frac{\\beta^{2} \\zeta + 1 - \\zeta}{1+\\beta^{2}}}, \\quad JAC = \\frac{TP}{1 - TN}.$$ {#eq-lfpm_metrics}\n\nSetting $\\beta = 1$ gives the F1 score, which is widely used as a classification metric in machine learning.\n\n### Preliminaries {#sec-me-preliminaries}\n#### Confusion Matrices {#sec-confusion-matrices .unnumbered}\n\nSince we are considering all possible metrics in the LPM and LFPM families, we need to make certain assumptions \nabout $\\mathcal{C}$. Particularly, we will assume that $g(t) = \\mathbb{P}[\\eta(X) \\geq t]$ is continuous and \nstrictly decreasing for $t \\in [0, 1]$; essentially, $\\eta$ has positive density and zero probability.\n\nAdditionally, $\\mathcal{C}$ is convex, closed, and contained within the rectangle $[0, \\zeta] \\times [0, 1-\\zeta]$, \nand is rotationally symmetric around its center, $(\\frac{\\zeta}{2}, \\frac{1-\\zeta}{2})$, where the axes represent the \nproportion of true positives and negatives. The only vertices of $\\mathcal{C}$ are $(0, 1-\\zeta)$ and $(\\zeta, 0)$, \ncorresponding to predicting all $0$'s or all $1$'s on a given dataset. Therefore, $\\mathcal{C}$ is strictly convex, \nand any line tangent to it is tangent at exactly one point, corresponding to one particular confusion matrix; these \nproperties can be visually observed in @fig-c.\n\n![Visual representation of $\\mathcal{C}$](Figures/Screenshot 2023-11-13 at 6.56.44 PM.png){#fig-c width=\"50%\"}\n\nNext, recall that an LPM is represented in terms of three parameters ($\\phi = m_{11}TP + m_{00}TN + m_0$). We have \njust seen that this LPM and its corresponding confusion matrix correspond to a certain point on the boundary of \n$\\mathcal{C}$. We first note that this point is independent of $m_0$. Additionally, we only care about the relative \nweightings of $m_{11}$ and $m_{00}$, not their actual values—they are scale invariant. Therefore, we can parametrize \nthe space of LPMs as $\\varphi_{LPM} = \\{\\mathbf{m} = (\\cos \\theta, \\sin \\theta) : \\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi]\\}$, where \n$\\cos \\theta$ corresponds to $m_{00}$ and $\\sin \\theta$ corresponds to $m_{11}$. As we already know, we can recover \nthe Bayes classifier given $\\mathbf{m}$, and it is unique, corresponding to one point on the boundary of $\\mathcal{C}$ \ndue to its convexity. The supporting hyperplane at this point is defined as\n\n$$\\bar{\\ell}_{\\mathbf{m}} := m_{11} \\cdot tp + m_{00} \\cdot tn = m_{11} \\overline{TP}_{\\mathbf{m}} + m_{00} \\overline{TN}_{\\mathbf{m}}$$  {#eq-eq3.47}\n\nWe note that if $m_{00}$ and $m_{11}$ have opposite signs, then $\\bar{h}_m$ is the trivial classifier predicting \nall 1's or all 0's, since either predicting true positives or true negatives results in negative reward. This corresponds \nto a supporting hyperplane with a positive slope, so it can only be tangent at the vertices.\n\nAdditionally, the boundary $\\partial \\mathcal{C}$ can be split into upper and lower boundaries \n($\\partial \\mathcal{C}_{+}, \\partial \\mathcal{C}_{-}$), corresponding to $\\theta \\in (0, \\pi/2)$ and $\\theta \\in (\\pi, 3\\pi/2)$ \nrespectively (and whether $m_{00}, m_{11}$ are positive or negative).\n\n#### Bayes Optimal and Inverse-Optimal Classifiers\n\nWe also define the notions of Bayes optimal and inverse-optimal classifiers. Given a performance metric $\\phi$, we define:\n\n-   The *Bayes utility* as $\\bar{\\tau} := \\sup_{h \\in \\mathcal{H}} \\phi(C(h)) = \\sup_{C \\in \\mathcal{C}} \\phi(C)$; \n    this is the highest achievable utility (using the metric $\\phi$) over all classifiers $h \\in $\\mathcal{H}$ for a given problem.\n-   The *Bayes classifier* as $\\bar{h} := \\arg \\max_{h \\in \\mathcal{H}} \\phi(C(h))$; this is the classifier $h$ corresponding to the Bayes utility.\n-   The *Bayes confusion matrix* as $\\bar{C} := \\arg \\max_{C \\in \\mathcal{C}} \\phi(C)$; this is the confusion matrix \n    corresponding to the Bayes utility and classifier.\n\nSimilarly, the inverse Bayes utility, classifier, and confusion matrix can be defined by replacing \"$\\sup$\" with \"$\\inf$\"; \nthey represent the classifier and confusion matrix corresponding to the lower bound on utility for a given problem.\n\nWe also have the following useful proposition:\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"proposition\"}\n::: {#prp-prp3.1}\nLet $\\phi \\in \\varphi_{LPM}$. Then\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n$$\\bar{h}(x) = \\left\\{\\begin{array}{lr}\n\\unicode{x1D7D9} \\left[\\eta(x) \\geq \\frac{m_{00}}{m_{11} + m_{00}}\\right], & m_{11} + m_{00} \\geq 0 \\\\\n\\unicode{x1D7D9} \\left[\\frac{m_{00}}{m_{11} + m_{00}} \\geq \\eta(x)\\right], & \\text { o.w. }\n\\end{array}\\right\\}$$  {#eq-eq3.45}\n:::\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"pdf\"}\n$$\\bar{h}(x) = \\left\\{\\begin{array}{lr}\n\\mathbbm{1}\\left[\\eta(x) \\geq \\frac{m_{00}}{m_{11} + m_{00}}\\right], & m_{11} + m_{00} \\geq 0 \\\\\n\\mathbbm{1}\\left[\\frac{m_{00}}{m_{11} + m_{00}} \\geq \\eta(x)\\right], & \\text { o.w. }\n\\end{array}\\right\\}$$  {#eq-eq3.46}\n:::\n\nis a Bayes optimal classifier with respect to $\\phi$. The inverse Bayes classifier is given by $\\underline{h} = 1 - \\bar{h}$.\n:::\n:::\n\nThis is a simple derivation based on the fact that we only get rewards from true positives and true negatives. \nEssentially, if we recover an LPM, we can use it to determine the best-performing classifier, obtained by placing \na threshold on the conditional probability of a given sample, that corresponds to a confusion matrix. Therefore, \nthe three notions of Bayes utility, classifier, and confusion matrix are functionally equivalent in our setting.\n\n\n### Problem Setup {#sec-metric-elicitation-setup}\n\nWe will now formalize the problem of metric elicitation. Given two classifiers $h$ and $h'$ (or equivalently, \ntwo confusion matrices $C$ and $C'$), we define an *oracle query* as the function:\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n$$\\Gamma\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)=\\Omega\\left(C, C^{\\prime}\\right)=\\unicode{x1D7D9}\\left[\\phi(C)>\\phi\\left(C^{\\prime}\\right)\\right]=: \\unicode{x1D7D9} \\left[C \\succ C^{\\prime}\\right],$$ {#eq-oracle}\n:::\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"pdf\"}\n$$\\Gamma\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)=\\Omega\\left(C, C^{\\prime}\\right)=\\mathbbm{1}\\left[\\phi(C)>\\phi\\left(C^{\\prime}\\right)\\right]=: \\mathbbm{1} \\left[C \\succ C^{\\prime}\\right],$$ {#eq-oracle}\n:::\n\nwhich represents the classifier preferred by the practitioner. We can then define the metric elicitation problem for populations:\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"definition\"}\n::: {#def-def3.1}\nSuppose the true (oracle) performance metric is $\\phi$. The goal is to recover a metric $\\hat{\\phi}$ by \nquerying the oracle for as few pairwise comparisons of the form $\\Omega\\left(C, C^{\\prime}\\right)$ so that \n$\\|\\phi - \\hat{\\phi}\\|_{--} < \\kappa$ for a sufficiently small $\\kappa > 0$ and for any suitable norm $\\|\\cdot\\|_{--}$.\n:::\n:::\n\nIn practice, we do not have access to the true probability distribution or the population, which would \nprovide the true values of $C$ and $C'$. However, we can subtly alter this problem description to use \n$\\hat{C}$ and $\\hat{C}^{\\prime}$, which are derived from our dataset of $n$ samples:\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"definition\"}\n::: {#def-def3.2}\nSuppose the true (oracle) performance metric is $\\phi$. The aim is to recover a metric $\\hat{\\phi}$ \nby querying the oracle for as few pairwise comparisons of the form $\\Omega\\left(\\hat{C}, \\hat{C}^{\\prime}\\right)$ \nso that $\\|\\phi - \\hat{\\phi}\\|_{--} < \\kappa$ for a sufficiently small $\\kappa > 0$ and for any suitable norm $\\|\\cdot\\|_{--}$.\n:::\n:::\n\nAs is common in theoretical ML research, we solve the population problem and then consider ways to extend this to \npractical settings where we only have limited datasets of samples. In our case, this corresponds to calculating the \nconfusion matrices from a portion of the dataset we have access to.\n\n\n### Linear Performance Metric Elicitation {#sec-orgb6dac4e}\n\nFor LPM elicitation, we need one more proposition.\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"proposition\"}\n::: {#prp-prp3.2}\nFor a metric $\\psi$ (quasiconvex and monotone increasing in TP/TN) or\n$\\phi$ (quasiconcave and monotone increasing), and parametrization\n$\\rho^+$/$\\rho^-$ of upper/lower boundary, composition\n$\\psi \\circ \\rho^-$ is quasiconvex and unimodal on \\[0, 1\\], and\n$\\phi \\circ \\rho^+$ is quasiconcave and unimodal on \\[0, 1\\].\n:::\n:::\n\nQuasiconcavity and quasiconvexity are slightly more general variations on concavity and convexity. Their main useful property in our setting is that they are unimodal (they have a singular extremum), so we can devise a binary-search-style algorithm for eliciting the Bayes optimal and inverse-optimal confusion matrices for a given setting, as well as the corresponding $\\phi$'s. We first note that to maximize a quasiconcave metric, in which $\\phi$ is monotonically increasing in $TP$ and $TN$, we note that the resulting maximizer (and supporting hyperplane) will occur on the upper boundary of $\\mathcal{C}$. We thus set our initial search range to be $[0, \\pi/2]$ and repeatedly divide it into four regions. Then, we calculate the resulting confusion matrix on the 5 resulting boundaries of these regions and query the oracle $4$ times. We repeat this in each iteration of the binary search until a maximizer is found.\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"remark\"}\n::: {#rem-explaination_binary_search}\nIn the case of quasiconcave and quasiconvex search ranges, a slightly more sophisticated variation on typical \nbinary search must be used. To illustrate this, consider the two distributions in @fig-bsearch:\n\n::: {#fig-bsearch layout-ncol=2}\n![First distribution](Figures/normaldistribution.png){#fig-normal-distribution width=\"45%\"}\n![Second distribution](Figures/normaldistribution copy.png){#fig-normal-distribution-copy width=\"45%\"}\n:::\n\nFor both the symmetric and skewed distributions, if we were to divide the search range into two portions and compare $A$, $C$, and $E$, we would find that $C > A$ and $C > E$. In both cases, this does not help us reduce our search range, since the true maximum could lie on either of the two intervals (as in the second case), or at $C$ itself (as in the first case). Therefore, we must make comparisons between all five points $A, B, C, D, and E$. This allows us to correctly restrict our search range to $[B, D]$ in the first case and $[C, E]$ in the second. These extra search requirements are due to the quasiconcavity of the search space we are considering, in which there exists a maximum but we need to make several comparisons at various points throughout the search space to be able to reduce its size in each iteration.\n:::\n:::\n\n```pseudocode\n#| label: alg-lpm\n\\begin{algorithm}\n    \\caption{Quasiconcave Metric Maximization}\n    \\begin{algorithmic}\n        \\State \\textbf{input:} $\\epsilon > 0$ and oracle $\\Omega$\n        \\State \\textbf{initialize:} $\\theta_a = 0, \\theta_b = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$\n        \\While{$|\\theta_b -

For this task, we will need the\nfollowing assumption:\n\nLet $\\phi \\in \\varphi_{L F P M}$. We assume\n$p_{11}, p_{00} \\geq 0, p_{11} \\geq q_{11}, p_{00} \\geq q_{00},$\n$p_{0}=0, q_{0}=$\n$\\left(p_{11}-q_{11}\\right) \\zeta+\\left(p_{00}-q_{00}\\right)(1-\\zeta)$,\nand $p_{11}+p_{00}=1$.\n\nThese assumptions guarantee that the LFPM $\\phi$ which we are trying to\nelicit is monotonically increasing in $TP$ and $TN$, just as in the LPM\nelicitation case.\n\nWe first provide motivation and an overview of the approach for LFPM\nelicitation and then present pseudocode for the algorithm.\n\nThe general idea of the algorithm is to use @alg-lpm to obtain a\nmaximizer and a minimizer for the given dataset; these result in two\nsystems of equations involving the true LFPM $\\phi^*$ with 1 degree of\nfreedom. Then, we run a grid search that is independent of oracle\nqueries to find the point where solutions to the systems match pointwise\non the resulting confusion matrices; this occurs close to where the true\nmetric lies.\n\nMore formally, suppose that the true metric is\n$$\\phi^{*}(C)=\\frac{p_{11}^{*} T P+p_{00}^{*} T N}{q_{11}^{*} T P+q_{00}^{*} T N+q_{0}^{*}}.$$  {#eq-eq3.48}\nThen, let $\\bar{\\tau}$ and $\\underline{\\tau}$ represent the maximizer\nand minimizer of $\\phi$ over $\\mathcal{C}$, respectively. There exists a\nhyperplane \n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\bar{\\ell}_{f}^{*}:=\\left(p_{11}^{*}-\\bar{\\tau}^{*} q_{11}^{*}\\right) t p+\\left(p_{00}^{*}-\\bar{\\tau}^{*} q_{00}^{*}\\right) t n=\\bar{\\tau}^{*} q_{0}^{*},\n\\end{aligned}$$   {#eq-eq3.49}\nwhich touches $\\mathcal{C}$ at $\\left(\\overline{T P}^{*}, \\overline{T N}^{*}\\right)$ on\n$\\partial \\mathcal{C}_{+}$.\n\nCorrespondingly, there also exists a hyperplane \n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\underline{\\ell}_{f}^{*}:=\\left(p_{11}^{*}-\\underline{\\tau}^{*} q_{11}^{*}\\right) t p+\\left(p_{00}^{*}-\\underline{\\tau}^{*} q_{00}^{*}\\right) \\operatorname{tn}=\\underline{\\tau}^{*} q_{0}^{*},\n\\end{aligned}$$   {#eq-eq3.50}\nwhich touches $\\mathcal{C}$ at $\\left(\\underline{TP}^{*}, \\underline{T N}^{*}\\right)$ on\n$\\partial \\mathcal{C}_{-}$. @fig-minmax illustrates this visually on $\\mathcal{C}$.\n\n![Visual representation of the minimizer and maximizer on\n$\\mathcal{C}$](Figures/Screenshot 2023-11-13 at 6.56.52 PM.png){#fig-minmax\nwidth=\"50%\"}\n\nWhile we are unable to obtain @eq-eq3.48 and @eq-eq3.49 directly, we can use @alg-lpm to get a hyperplane\n$$\\bar{\\ell}:=\\bar{m}_{11} t p+\\bar{m}_{00} t n= \\bar{m}_{11} \\overline{T P}^{*}+\\bar{m}_{00} \\overline{T N}^{*} = \\bar{C}_{0},$$  {#eq-eq3.51}\nwhich is equivalent to $\\bar{\\ell}_{f}^{*}$ (@eq-eq3.48) up to a constant\nmultiple. From here, we can obtain the system of equations\n\n$$p_{11}^{*}-\\bar{\\tau}^{*} q_{11}^{*}=\\alpha \\bar{m}_{11}, p_{00}^{*}-\\bar{\\tau}^{*} q_{00}^{*}=\\alpha \\bar{m}_{00}, \\bar{\\tau}^{*} q_{0}^{*}=\\alpha \\bar{C}_{0},$$  {#eq-eq3.52}\nwhere $\\alpha > 0$ (we know it is $\\geq0$ due to our assumptions earlier\nand because $\\bar{m}$ is positive, but if it is equal to $0$ then\n$\\phi^*$ would be constant. So, our resulting system of equations is\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n    p_{11}^{\\prime}-\\bar{\\tau}^{*} q_{11}^{\\prime}=\\bar{m}_{11}, p_{00}^{\\prime}-\\bar{\\tau}^{*} q_{00}^{\\prime}=\\bar{m}_{00}, \\bar{\\tau}^{*} q_{0}^{\\prime}=\\bar{C}_{0}.\n\\end{aligned}$$  {#eq-eq3.53}\n\nNow, similarly, we can approximate @eq-eq3.49 using the algorithm we defined\nfor quasiconvex metrics (@alg-lfpm), where we altered the search range\nand comparisons. After finding the minimizer, we obtain the hyperplane\n$$\\underline{\\ell}:=\\underline{m}_{11} t p+\\underline{m}_{00} t n=\\underline{m}_{11} \\underline{TP}^{*}+\\underline{m}_{00} \\underline{TN}^{*} = \\underline{C}_{0},$$  {#eq-eq3.54}\nwhich is equivalent to $\\underline{\\ell}_{f}^{*}$ (@eq-eq3.49) up to a constant\nmultiple. So then, our system of equations is\n$$p_{11}^{*}-\\underline{\\tau}^{*} q_{11}^{*}=\\gamma \\underline{m}_{11}, p_{00}^{*}-\\underline{\\tau}^{*} q_{00}^{*}=\\gamma \\underline{m}_{00}, \\underline{\\tau}^{*} q_{0}^{*}=\\gamma \\underline{C}_{0},$$  {#eq-eq3.55}\nwhere $\\gamma <0$ (for a reason analogous to why we have $\\alpha >0$),\nmeaning our resulting system of equations is \n$$\\begin{aligned}\n    p_{11}^{\\prime \\prime}-\\underline{\\tau}^{*} q_{11}^{\\prime \\prime}=\\underline{m}_{11}, p_{00}^{\\prime \\prime}-\\underline{\\tau}^{*} q_{00}^{\\prime \\prime}=\\underline{m}_{00}, \\underline{\\tau}^{*} q_{0}^{\\prime \\prime}=\\underline{C}_{0}.\n\\end{aligned}$$  {#eq-eq3.56}\n\n@eq-eq3.55 and @eq-eq3.56 form the two systems of equations mentioned in our overview\nof the algorithm. Next, we demonstrate that they have only one degree of\nfreedom. Note that if we know $p_{11}'$, we could solve both systems of\nequations as follows: \n$$\\begin{aligned}\n    p_{00}^{\\prime}  &=1-p_{11}^{\\prime}, q_{0}^{\\prime}=\\bar{C}_{0} \\frac{P^{\\prime}}{Q^{\\prime}}\\\\\n    q_{11}^{\\prime}  &=\\left(p_{11}^{\\prime}-\\bar{m}_{11}\\right) \\frac{P^{\\prime}}{Q^{\\prime}} \\\\\n    q_{00}^{\\prime}&=\\left(p_{00}^{\\prime}-\\bar{m}_{00}\\right) \\frac{P^{\\prime}}{Q^{\\prime}},\n\\end{aligned}$$   {#eq-eq3.57}\nwhere\n$P^{\\prime}=p_{11}^{\\prime} \\zeta+p_{00}^{\\prime}(1-\\zeta)$ and\n$Q^{\\prime}=P^{\\prime}+\\bar{C}_{0}-$\n$\\bar{m}_{11} \\zeta-\\bar{m}_{00}(1-\\zeta).$\n\nNow, suppose we know $p_{11}'$. We could use this value to solve both systems @eq-eq3.55 and @eq-eq3.56, \nyielding two metrics, $\\phi'$ and $\\phi''$, from the maximizer and minimizer, respectively. Importantly, when\n$$p_{11}^{*} / p_{00}^{*}=p_{11}^{\\prime} / p_{00}^{\\prime}=p_{11}^{\\prime \\prime} / p_{00}^{\\prime \\prime},$$ {#eq-eq3.58} \nthen\n$\\phi^{*}(C)=\\phi^{\\prime}(C) / \\alpha=-\\phi^{\\prime \\prime}(C) / \\gamma$.\nEssentially, when we find a value of $p_{11}'$ that results in $\\phi'$ and $\\phi''$ h\naving constant ratios at all points on the boundary of $\\mathcal{C}$, we can obtain $\\phi^*$, \nas it is derivable from $\\phi'$ and $\\alpha$ (or, alternatively, $\\phi''$ and $\\gamma$).\n\nWe will perform a grid search for $p_{11}'$ on $[0,1]$. For each point in our search, \nwe will compute $\\phi'$ and $\\phi''$. Then, we will generate several confusion matrices \non the boundaries and calculate the ratio $\\phi'' / $\\phi'$ for each. We will select the value \nof $p_{11}'$ for which the ratio $\\phi'' / \\phi'$ is closest to constant and use it to compute \nthe elicited metric $\\hat{\\phi}$.

For further interesting exploration of the types of problems that can be solved using the framework of metric elicitation, we refer the reader to [@nips], which performs metric elicitation to determine the oracle's ideal tradeoff between the classifier's overall performance and the discrepancy between its performance on certain protected groups.\n\n### Multiclass Performance Metric Elicitation\n\nAlthough the previous section only described metric elicitation for binary classification problems, the general framework can still be applied to multiclass classification problems, as described in \"Multiclass Performance Metric Elicitation\" by [@NEURIPS2019_1fd09c5f]. Consider the case of classifying subtypes of leukemia [@YangNaiman+2014+477+496]. We can train a neural network to predict conditional probability of a certain leukemia subtype given certain gene expressions. However, it may not be appropriate to classify the subtype purely based on whichever one has the highest confidence. For instance, a treatment for leukemia subtype C1 may be perfect for cases of C1, but it may be ineffective or harmful for certain other subtypes. Therefore, the final response from the classifier may not be as simple as as choosing the class with the highest conditional probability, just like how the threshold for binary classification may not always be 50%. With multiclass metric elicitation, we can show confusion matrices to an oracle (like the doctor in the leukemia example) to determine which classifier has the best tradeoffs. In [@NEURIPS2019_1fd09c5f], the authors focus on eliciting linear performance metrics, which is what we will describe in this chapter. Most of the notation from Binary Metric Elicitation still persists, just modified to provide categorical responses. $X \\in \\mathcal{X}$ is the input random variable. $Y \\in [k]$ is the output random variable, where $[k]$ is the index set $\\{1, 2, \\dots, k\\}$.\n\nThe dataset of size $n$ is denoted by $\\{(\\vec{x}, y)\\}_{i=1}^n$ generated independently and identically from $\\mathbb{P}(X, Y)$. $\\eta_i(\\vec{x}) = \\mathbb{P}(Y=i | X=\\vec{x})$ gives the conditional probability of class $i \\in [k]$ given an observation. $\\xi_i = \\mathbb{P}(Y=i)$ is the marginal probability of class $i \\in [k]$. The set of all classifiers is $\\mathcal{H} = \\{h : \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\Delta_k\\}$, where $\\Delta_k$ is (k-1) dimensional simplex. In this case, the outputs of classifiers are 1-hot vectors of size $k$ where the only index with value 1 is the predicted class and all other positions have a value of 0. The confusion matrix for a classifier, $h$, is $C(h, \\mathbb{P}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k \\times k}$, where:\n\n$$C_{ij}(h, \\mathbb{P}) = \\mathbb{P}(Y=i, h=j) \\text{\\qquad for } i, j \\in [k]$$  {#eq-eq3.59}\n\nNote that the confusion matrices are $k\\times k$ and store the joint probabilities of each type of classification for each possible class. This means that the sum of row $i$ in the confusion matrix equals $\\xi_i$, because this is equivalent to adding over all possible classifications. Since we know the sums of each row, all diagonal elements can be reconstructed from just the off-diagonal elements, so a confusion matrix $C(h, \\mathbb{P})$ can be expressed as a vector of off-diagonal elements, $\\vec{c}(h, \\mathbb{P}) = \\textit{off-diag}(C(h, \\mathbb{P}))$, and $\\vec{c} \\in \\mathbb{R}^q$ where $q := k^2 - k$. The vector $\\vec{c}$ is called the vector of *'off-diagonal confusions.'* The space of off-diagonal confusions is $\\mathcal{C} = \\{\\vec{c}(h, \\mathbb{P}) : h \\in \\mathcal{H}\\}$.\n\nIn cases where the oracle would care about the exact type of misclassification (i.e. misclassifying and object from class 1 as class 2), this off-diagonal confusion matrix is necessary. However, there are many cases where the performance of a classifier is determined by just the probability of correct prediction for each class, which just requires the diagonal elements. In these cases, we can define the vector of *'diagonal confusions'* as $\\vec{d}(h, \\mathbb{P}) = \\textit{diag}(C(h, \\mathbb{P})) \\in \\mathbb{R}^k$. The space of diagonal confusions is $\\mathcal{D} = \\{\\vec{d}(h, \\mathbb{P}) : h \\in \\mathcal{H}\\}$.\n\nFinally, the setup for metric elicitation is identical to the one examined in the previous chapter. We still assume access to an oracle that can choose between two classifiers or confusion matrices, using notation $\\Gamma$ for comparing two classifiers and $\\Omega$ for comparing confusion matrices, which returns 1 if the first classifier is better and 0 otherwise. We still assume that the oracle behaves according to some unknown performance metric, and we wish to recover this metric up to some small error tolerance (based on a suitable norm). The two different types of confusion vectors result in different algorithms for metric elicitation, which we will explore in later sections.\n\nA Diagonal Linear Performance Metric (DLPM) is a performance metric that only considers the diagonal elements in the confusion matrix. The metric is defined as $\\psi(\\vec{d}) = \\langle \\vec{a}, \\vec{d} \\rangle$, where $\\vec{a} \\in \\mathbb{R}^k$ such that $||\\vec{a}||_1 = 1$. It is also called weighted accuracy [@pmlr-v37-narasimhanb15]. The family of DLPMs is denoted as $\\varphi_{DLPM}$. Since these only consider the diagonal elements, which we want to maximize, we can focus on only eliciting monotonically increasing DLPMs, meaning that all elements in $\\vec{a}$ are non-negative.\n\nConsider the trivial classifiers that only predict a single class at all times. The diagonal confusions when only predicting class $i$ are $\\vec{v}_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^k$ with $\\xi_i$ at index $i$ and zero elsewhere. Note that this is the maximum possible value in index $i$, because this represents perfectly classifying all points that have a true class of $i$. We can consider the space of diagonal confusions, visualized in @fig-diag_geom (taken from [@NEURIPS2019_1fd09c5f]). The space of $\\mathcal{D}$ is strictly convex, closed, and contained in the box $[0, \\xi_1] \\times \\dots \\times [0, \\xi_k]$. We also know that the only vertices are $\\vec{v}_i$ for each $i \\in [k]^{(k-1)}$.\n\n![(a) Geometry of space of diagonal confusions for $k=3$. This is a convex region with three flat areas representing confusions when restricted to only two classes. (b) Geometry of diagonal confusions when restricted to classes $k_1$ and $k_2$. Notice how this is identical to the space of confusion matrices examined in the previous chapter.](Figures/diag_geometry.png){#fig-diag_geom width=\"\\\\textwidth\"}\n\nWe know that this is strictly convex under the assumption that an object from any class can be misclassified as any other class. Mathematically, the assumption is that $g_{ij}(r) = \\mathbb{P} \\left[\\frac{\\eta_i(X)}{\\eta_j(X)} \\geq r \\right]$ $\\forall i, j \\in [k]$ are continuous and strictly decreasing for $r \\in [0, \\infty)$.\n\nWe can also define the space of binary classification confusion matrices confined to classes $k_1$ and $k_2$, which is the 2-D $(k_1, k_2)$ axis-aligned face of $\\mathcal{D}$, denoted as $\\mathcal{D}_{k_1, k_2}$. Note that this is strictly convex, since $\\mathcal{D}$ itself is strictly convex, and it has the same geometry as the space of binary confusion matrices examined in the previous chapter. Therefore, we can construct an RBO classifier for $\\psi \\in \\varphi_{DLPM}$, parameterized by $\\vec{a}$, as follows: \n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\bar{h}_{k_1, k_2}(\\vec{x})= \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n      k_1, \\text{ if } a_{k_1} \\eta_{k_1}(\\vec{x}) \\geq a_{k_2} \\eta_{k_2}(\\vec{x})\\\\\nk_2, \\text{ o.w.}\n\\end{array}\n\\right\\}.\n\\end{aligned}$$ {#eq-rbo_eq}\n\nWe can parameterize the upper boundary of $\\mathcal{D}_{k_1, k_2}$,\ndenoted as $\\partial \\mathcal{D}^{+}_{k_1, k_2}$, using a single\nparameter $m \\in [0, 1]$. Specifically, we can construct a DLPM by\nsetting $a_{k_1} = m$, $a_{k_2} = 1 - m$, and all others to 0. Using\n[@eq-rbo_eq], we can get the diagonal confusions, so varying $m$ parameterizes\n$\\partial \\mathcal{D}^{+}_{k_1, k_2}$. The parameterization is denoted\nas $\\nu(m; k_1, k_2)$.\n\n#### Diagonal Linear Performance Metric Elicitation\n\nSuppose the oracle follows a true metric, $\\psi$, that is linear and\nmonotone increasing across all axes. If we consider the composition\n$\\psi \\circ \\nu(m; k_1, k_2): [0, 1] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, we know it\nmust be concave and unimodal, because $\\mathcal{D}_{k_1, k_2}$ is a\nconvex set. Therefore, we can find the value of $m$ that maximizes\n$\\psi \\circ \\nu(m; k_1, k_2)$ for any given $k_1$ and $k_2$ using a\nbinary search procedure.\n\nSince the RBO classifier for classes $k_1$ and $k_2$ only rely on the\nrelative weights of the classes in the DLPM (see [@eq-rbo_eq]), finding\nthe value of $m$ that maximizes $\\psi \\circ \\nu(m; k_1, k_2)$ gives us\nthe true relative ratio between $a_{k_1}$ and $a_{k_2}$. Specifically,\nfrom the definition of $\\nu$, we know that\n$\\frac{a_{k_2}}{a_{k_1}} = \\frac{1-m}{m}$. We can therefore simply\ncalculate the ratio between $a_1$ and all other weights to reconstruct\nan estimate for the true metric.

The comparisons in turn help robots learn the reward function of the human, which allows them to further take actions in real settings. Let's say there are two trajectories $\\xi_A$ and $\\xi_B$ that might be taken as the next course of action in any context, like choosing the next turn, or choosing the next chatGPT response. The robot is offering both to a human for comparison. To answer which of them is better, the human would ask themselves if $R(\\xi_A)$ or $R(\\xi_B)$ is bigger, with $R(\\xi) = w * \\phi(\\xi)$ being the reward function. In this equation $w$ and $\\phi(\\xi)$ are vectors of weights and features of the trajectory, so alternatively, we can express this as:\n\n$$R(\\xi) = \\begin{bmatrix} w_1 \\\\ w_2 \\\\ ... \\\\ w_N \\end{bmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{bmatrix} \\phi_1(\\xi) \\\\ \\phi_2(\\xi) \\\\ ... \\\\ \\phi_N(\\xi) \\end{bmatrix}$$ {#eq-reward_eq}\n\nIf one says that they preferred $\\xi_2$ less than $\\xi_1$ then it means $\\xi_2 < \\xi_1 \\implies R(\\xi_2) < R(\\xi_1) \\implies w * \\phi(\\xi_2) < w * \\phi(\\xi_1) \\implies 0 < w * (\\phi(\\xi_1) - \\phi(\\xi_2)) \\implies 0 < w * \\Phi$. Alternatively, if one preferred $\\xi_2$ more than $\\xi_1$, the signs would be flipped, resulting in $0 > w * \\Phi$. The two results can be represented in the N-dimensional space, where when it is split by the decision boundary, it creates half-spaces indicating preferences for each of the sides. For example we can see how a query between two objects can split the plain into two halves, indicating preference towards one of the objects. Such an image can be extended into bigger dimensions, where a line would become a separating hyperplane. If one is to truly believe the answers of one person, they would remove everything from the other side of the hyperplane that does not agree with the received human preference. But since humans are noisy, that approach is not optimal, thus most applications up-weight the indicated side of the plane to emphasize that points on that side are better, and down-weight the other side as they do not agree with the provided comparison.\n\nHow should someone choose which queries to conduct, otherwise, what is the most informative query sequence? After completing one query, the next query should be orthogonal to the previous one so that the potential space consistent with the preferences decreases in half. The intuition behind that is the potential space has all of the reward functions that agree with the provided answers, so to find a specific reward function for a human, decreasing the space narrows down the possible options. The original query created the blue space, and a new one created a red space, resulting in a purple intersection of the two which is still consistent with both of the queries's results. The image shows that the purple portion is exactly half of the blue portion.\n\n![Creating further comparisons limits the space that agrees with answers to all of them. The blue area demonstrates a preference for object 1 over object 2. The red area demonstrates a preference for object 3 over object 4. Combination (purple area) shows the space that is consistent with both of those preferences.](Figures/2D-space.jpg){#fig-2dspace width=\"40%\"}\n\nMathematically, from [@pmlr-v87-biyik18a] this can be expressed as set $F$ of potential queries $\\phi$, where $F = \\{\\phi: \\phi = \\Phi(\\xi_A) - \\Phi(\\xi_B), \\xi_A, \\xi_B \\in \\Xi\\}$ (defining that a query is the difference between the features of two trajectories). Using that, the authors define a human update function $f_{\\phi}(w) = \\min(1, \\exp(I^T\\phi))$ that accounts for how much of the space will still be consistent with the preferences. Finally, for a specific query, they define the minimum volume removed as $\\min\\{\\mathbb{E}[1 - f_{\\phi}(w)], \\mathbb{E}[1 - f_{-\\phi}(w)]\\}$ (expected size of the two sides of the remaining space after it is split by a query - purple area in @fig-2dspace), and the final goal is to maximize that amount over all possible queries since it is optimal to get rid of as much space as possible to narrow down the options for the reward function: $\\max_{\\phi} \\min\\{ \\mathbb{E}[1 - f_{\\phi}(w)], \\mathbb{E}[1 - f_{-\\phi}(w)]\\}$. Effectively this is finding such $\\phi$ that maximizes the information one can get by asking the next comparison query. While this approach uses minimum volume removed, there can be other metrics inside the $\\max$ function. Some applications like movie recommendations do not require extra constraints, however in robotics one might want to add more constraints that satisfy certain rules, so that the resulting query follows the dynamics of the physical world.\n\nThe first real example of learning reward functions from pairwise comparisons is a 2D driving simulator from [@pmlr-v87-biyik18a]. In @fig-car_direct you can see the setting of a 3-lane road with the orange car being controlled by the computer. The queries conducted for this problem are two different trajectories presented to the human, and they are asked to evaluate which one of them is better. For the features that contribute to the reward function, it is important to consider that robots might not find some of the information as informative for the learning process as a human would. For this example, the underlying features included the distance between lane boundaries, distance to other cars, and the heading and speed of the controlled car. The weights toward the last feature were weighted the highest according to the authors, since it takes a lot of effort for the car to change or correct its direction.\n\nAt the start of the learning process, the car had no direction learned and was moving all over the road. In the middle of learning after 30 queries, the simulator learned to follow the direction of the road and go straight but still experienced collisions. After 70 queries, the simulator learned to avoid collisions, as well as keep the car within the lane without swerving.\n\n#### Active Learning for Pairwise Comparisons\n\nWe have discussed that pairwise comparisons should be selected to maximize the minimum volume of remaining options removed. The question that can come out of the driving example is does it really matter to follow that goal or does random choice of queries performs as well? It turns out that indeed most AL algorithms (purposefully selecting queries) over time converge with the performance of the random query selection, so in long term the performance is similar. However, what is different is that AL achieves better performance earlier, which in time-sensitive tasks can be a critical factor. One example of such a setting can be exoskeletons for humans as part of the rehabilitation after surgery [@Li_2021]. Different people have significantly different walking patterns as well as rehabilitation requirements, so the exoskeleton needs to adapt to the human as soon as possible for a more successful rehabilitation. Figure @fig-robotics demonstrates the difference in the time needed between the two approaches. In general, in robotics, the time differences that might seem small to a human might be detrimental to the final performance.\n\n![Performance of AL and random query selection algorithms in the task of exoskeleton learning with human preferences. [@Li_2021]](Figures/robo_graph.png){#fig-robotics width=\"60%\"}\n\nIn conclusion, pairwise comparisons show to be a great way of learning linear reward functions, but at times present challenges or incapabilities that can be further improved with additional incorporations of approaches like AL. That improves many applications in terms of time spent getting to the result in case of exoskeleton adjustments, as well as getting to a middle ground between polar behaviors in applications like negotiations.\n\n### Application: Guiding Human Demonstrations in Robotics\n\nA strong approach to learning policies for robotic manipulation is imitation learning, the technique of learning behaviors from human demonstrations. In particular, interactive imitation learning allows a group of humans to contribute their own demonstrations for a task, allowing for scalable learning. However, not all groups of demonstrators are equally helpful for interactive imitation learning.\n\nThe ideal set of demonstrations for imitation learning would follow a single, optimal method for performing the task, which a robot could learn to mimic. Conversely, *multimodality*, the presence of multiple optimal methods in the demonstration set, is challenging for imitation learning since it has to learn from contradicting information for how to accomplish a task. A common reason for multimodality is the fact that different people often subconsciously choose different paths for execution, as illustrated in @fig-multimodalexecution.\n\n![Examples of two different ways to insert a nut onto a round peg. The orange demonstration picks up the nut from the hole while the blue demonstration picks up the nut from the side [@gandhi2022eliciting]](Figures/multimodal_peg.png){#fig-multimodalexecution width=\"50%\"}\n\nGandhi et al. [@gandhi2022eliciting] identifies whether demonstrations are compatible with one another and offer an active elicitation interface to guide humans to provide better demonstrations in interactive imitation learning. Their key motivation is to allow multiple users to contribute demonstrations over the course of data collection by guiding users towards compatible demonstrations. To identify whether a demonstration is \"compatible\" with a base policy trained with prior demonstrations, the researchers measure the *likelihood* of demonstrated actions under the base policy, and the *novelty* of the visited states. Intuitively, low likelihood and low novelty demonstrations should be excluded since they represent conflicting modes of behavior on states that the robot can already handle, and are therefore incompatible. This concept of compatibility is used for filtering a new set of demonstrations and actively eliciting compatible demonstrations. In the following subsections, we describe the process of estimating compatibility and active elicitation in more detal.\n\n#### Estimating Compatiblity\n\nWe want to define a compatibility measure $\\mathcal{M}$, that estimates the performance of policy $\\pi_{base}$ that is retrained on a union of $\\mathcal{D}_{base}$, the known base dataset, and $\\mathcal{D}_{new}$, the newly collected dataset. To define this compatibility measure in a way that is easy to compute, we can use two interpretable metrics: likelihood and novelty. The likelihood of actions $a_{new}$ in $\\mathcal{D}_{new}$ is measured as the negative mean squared error between actions predicted by the base policy and this proposed action:\n\n$$likelihood(s_{new}, a_{new}) = -\\mathbb{E}[|| \\pi_{base}(s_{new}) - a_{new} ||^2_2].$$  {#eq-eq3.61}\n\nThe novelty of the state $s_{new}$ in $\\mathcal{D}_{new}$ is the standard deviation in the predicted actions under base policy:\n\n$$novelty(s_{new}) = \\mathrm{Var}[\\pi_{base}(s_{new})].$$  {#eq-eq3.62}\n\nWe can plot likelihood and novelty on a 2D plane, as shown in @fig-likelihood_novelty, and identify thresholds on\nlikelihood and novelty, denoted as $\\lambda$ and $\\eta$ respectively.\nIntuitively, demonstrations with low likelihood in low novelty states\nshould be excluded, because this indicates that there is a conflict\nbetween the base behavior and the new demonstration due to\nmultimodality. Note that in high novelty states, the likelihood should\nbe disregarded because the base policy does not have a concrete idea for\nhow to handle these states anyways so more data is needed.\n\n![Examples of plots of likelihood and novelty for compatible and\nincompatible operators\n[@gandhi2022eliciting]](Figures/likelihood_novelty.png){#fig-likelihood_novelty\nwidth=\"80%\"}\n\nThe final compatibility metric, parameterized by the likelihood and\nnovelty thresholds $\\lambda$ and $\\eta$, is\n$\\mathcal{M}(\\mathcal{D}_{base}, (s_{new}, a_{new})) \\in [0, 1]$,\ndefined as:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n    \\mathcal{M} = \\begin{cases} \n        1 - \\min(\\frac{\\mathbb{E}[|| \\pi_{base}(s_{new}) - a_{new} ||^2_2]}{\\lambda}, 1) & \\text{ if } \\text{novelty}(s_{new}) < \\eta \\\\\n        1 & \\text{ otherwise }\n       \\end{cases}.\n\\end{aligned}$$  {#eq-eq3.63}\n\nNote that $\\lambda$ and $\\eta$ need to be specified by hand. This is\naccomplished by assuming the ability to collect *a priori incompatible*\ndemonstrations to identify reasonable thresholds that remove the most\ndatapoints in the incompatible demonstrations while keeping the most\ndatapoints in the compatible demonstrations.\n\n#### Case Studies with Fixed Sets\n\nThe researchers evaluate the utility of the compatibility metric on\nthree tasks: placing a square nut on a square peg, placing a round nut\non a round peg, and opening a drawer and placing a hammer inside. For\neach task, they train a base policy using a \"proficient\" operator's\ndemonstration while sampling trajectories from other operators for the\nnew set.\n\nThe naive baseline is to use all datapoints while the\n$\\mathcal{M}$-Filtered demonstrations use the compatibility metric to\nfilter out incompatible demonstrations. The results are presented in\n@tbl-m_filter_table. As you can see, M-filtering results in\nequal or greater performance despite using less data than the naive\nbaseline, demonstrating the effectiveness of compatibility-based\nfiltering.\n\n::: {#tbl-m_filter_table}\n  --------------- ---------------- ------------------------ --------------- ------------------------ ---------------------- ------------------------\n                   Square Nut                                    Round Nut                             Hammer Placement  \n  Operator         Naive            $\\mathcal{M}$-Filtered       Naive       $\\mathcal{M}$-Filtered    Naive                 $\\mathcal{M}$-Filtered\n  Base Operator      38.7 (2.1)               \\-              13.3 (2.3)               \\-                  24.7 (6.1)                  \\-\n  Operator 1         54.3 (1.5)           61.0 (4.4)          26.7 (11.7)         32.0 (12.2)              38.0 (2.0)              39.7 (4.6)\n  Operator 2         40.3 (5.1)           42.0 (2.0)          22.0 (7.2)           26.7 (5.0)              33.3 (3.1)              32.7 (6.4)\n  Operator 3         37.3 (2.1)           42.7 (0.6)          17.3 (4.6)          18.0 (13.9)              8.0 (0.0)               12.0 (0.0)\n  Operator 4         27.3 (3.5)           37.3 (2.1)           7.3 (4.6)           13.3 (1.2)              4.0 (0.0)               4.0 (0.0)\n  --------------- ---------------- ------------------------ --------------- ------------------------ ---------------------- ------------------------\n\n  : Success rates (mean/std across 3 training runs) for policies trained\n  on $\\mathcal{D}_{new}$ by using all the data (Naive) or filtering by\n  compatibility ($\\mathcal{M}$-Filtered) [@gandhi2022eliciting]\n:::\n\n![The phases of the active elicitation interface: (a) initial prompting,\n(b) demonstrations with live feedback, and (c) corrective feedback\n[@gandhi2022eliciting]](Figures/active_elicitation.png){#fig-active_elicitation\nwidth=\"80%\"}\n\n#### Actively Eliciting Compatible Demonstrations\n\nIn the previous section, we assume access to a dataset that has already\nbeen collected, and we see how filtering out incompatible demonstrations\nhelps improve performance. However, when collecting a new dataset, it\nwould be better to ensure that operators collect compatible\ndemonstrations from the start, allowing us to retain as much data as\npossible for training.\n\nTo actively elicit compatible demonstrations, the researchers set up a\npipeline for live feedback and examples. At the start, operators are\ngiven a task specification and some episodes to practice using the\nrobot. Then, the active elicitation process begins, as shown in @fig-active_elicitation. Each operator is shown some\nrollouts of the base policy to understand the style of the base\noperator. Next, the operator provides a demonstration similar to the\nones they were shown. As they record their demonstrations, the interface\nprovides online feedback, with green indicating compatible actions and\nred indicating incompatible actions. If the number of incompatible\nstate-action pairs (ones where $\\mathcal{M}$ is zero) exceeds 5% of the\ndemonstration length, the demonstration is rejected. However, to provide\ncorrective feedback, the interface shows the areas of the demonstration\nwith the highest average incompatibility and also provides an expert\ndemo that shows what should actually be done. Demonstrators can use this\nfeedback to provide more compatible demonstrations moving forward.\n\nThis process helps improve the demonstration quality in both simulation\nand real experiments, as show in @tbl-active_elicitation_results. Specifically, on the real\nresults, active elicitation outperformed the base policy by 25% and\nnaive data collection by 55%. Overall, active elicitation is a powerful\ntool to ensure that data collected for imitation learning improves the\nquality of the learned policy.\n\n::: {#tbl-active_elicitation_results}\n  Task                                            Base     Naive    Naive + Filtered   Informed\n  ------------------------------------------------- ------------ ------------- ---------------------- --------------\n  Round Nut                                      13.3 (2.3)    9.6 (4.6)         9.7 (4.2)          15.7 (6.0)\n  Hammer Placement                               24.7 (6.1)   20.8 (15.7)       22.0 (15.5)        31.8 (16.3)\n  $\\left[ \\textup{Real} \\right]$ Food Plating       60.0      30.0 (17.3)            \\-             85.0 (9.6)\n\n  : Success rates (mean/std across users) for policies trained on\n  $\\mathcal{D}_{new}$ by using all the data (Naive), filtering by\n  compatibility ($\\mathcal{M}$-Filtered), or using informed\n  demonstration collection [@gandhi2022eliciting]\n:::\n\nA fundamental limitation of eliciting compatible demonstrations is the\nfact that the \"base\" demonstrator is considered the ground truth. When\nthe base demonstrator specifies a preference, all other demonstrators\nmust abide by it, even if they have strong preferences against it. For\ninstance, when pouring milk and cereal into a bowl, different people\nhave different preferences for what is the correct order, but active\nelicitation forces all demonstrators to follow the initial preference of\nthe base operator. The researchers hope that future work can enable\nusers to override the default demonstration set and follow a base\nbehavior that better aligns with their preferences. This could enable\nmultiple modes of behavior to be collected in data while only following\na user's specified preference instead of attempting to collapse all\nmodes into a single policy.\n\nLooking forward, active elicitation provides a foundation for allowing\nrobots to query humans about the type of data needed, enabling more\nefficient data collection through transparency.\n\nIn summary, this chapter has explored the complexities and innovations\nin interAL as applied to large models within robotics. It\nbegins by investigating pairwise comparisons and their role in\nefficiently learning linear reward functions from large datasets,\novercoming limitations in supervised learning. When combined with active\nlearning techniques, these comparisons supply timely, targeted, and\ncontext-appropriate feedback, enhancing performance in time-critical\napplications like exoskeleton adjustments during rehabilitation.\n\nWe then shift to imitation learning or inverse reward learning from\ndemonstrations, emphasizing the difficulties introduced by multimodal\ndemonstration sets. active elicitation approaches to compile compatible\ndemonstrations, streamlining the learning process by guiding users to\nprovide more valuable, steady examples are incredibly promising,\nhowever, to tackling this issue. This method shows promise in refining\nthe interactive imitation learning data collection pipeline, enabling\nmore capable and effective robotic training.\n\nAdditionally, the chapter examines the integration of foundation models\ninto robotics, highlighting the transformative innovations of R3M and\nVoltron. R3M's pre-training on diverse human activities dramatically\nimproves robotic manipulation with minimal supervision. Meanwhile,\nVoltron builds on these capabilities by incorporating language-driven\nrepresentation learning for remarkably adaptable and nuanced robotic\ntask performance. These models represent significant leaps in robotics\nwhile opening new frontiers for future research and applications.\n\n\n\n## Exercises\n### Question 1: Uncertainty Quantification in Preference Learning (40 points) {#sec-question-1-uncertainty-quantification-in-preference-learning-40-points .unnumbered}\n\nIn this question, we will explore Bayesian approaches to logistic\nregression in the context of preference learning using the Bradley-Terry\nmodel. We will compare different models and inference methods, including\nparametric linear models estimated using Metropolis-Hastings, parametric\nneural network models estimated using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, and\nnon-parametric models with Gaussian Processes. Finally, we will assess\nthe uncertainty quantification in these models using the Expected\nCalibration Error (ECE).\n\nAssume we have a dataset of pairwise preferences\n$\\mathcal{D} = \\{(x_i, y_i)\\}_{i=1}^N$, where $x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$\nrepresents the feature difference between two items (i.e.,\n$x_i = e^{(i)}_1 - e^{(i)}_2$ for embeddings $e^{(i)}_1$ and\n$e^{(i)}_2$), and $y_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ indicates the preference ($y_i = 1$\nif item 1 is preferred over item 2 in the $i$-th pair).\n\nThe likelihood of observing $y_i$ given $x_i$ and model parameters\n$\\theta$ is given by the logistic function:\n\n$$P(y_i = 1 | x_i, \\theta) = \\sigma(x_i^\\top \\theta) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x_i^\\top \\theta}}.$$\n\nWe will adopt a Bayesian approach by placing priors on the model\nparameters and using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to estimate\nthe posterior distributions.\n\n(a) **Uncertainty Quantification and Expected Calibration Error (11\n    points)**\n\n    (i) **(Written, 2 point)**.

We will use expected\ninformation gain as the acquisition function to select the most\ninformative queries, where each query is a pair of items. Assume that we\nmodel the preferences using a simple linear model. Given feature vectors\n$x_1$ and $x_2$ corresponding to two items, the probability that $x_1$\nis preferred over $x_2$ is modeled using a logistic regression model,\ni.e.,\n\n$$P(x_1 \\succ x_2 | \\theta) = \\sigma(\\theta^\\top (x_1 - x_2)),$$\n\nwhere $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ is the model parameter vector, and\n$\\sigma(z)$ is the sigmoid function $\\sigma(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$.\nThe goal is to sequentially select pairs of items to maximize the\ninformation gained about $\\theta$ through preference queries.\n\n(a) **Expected Information Gain (15 points)**\n\n    (i) **Derive the Expected Information Gain (Written, 3 points).**\n        Suppose that after observing a preference between two items\n        $x_1$ and $x_2$, the posterior distribution over $\\theta$ is\n        updated. The information gain from this observation is the\n        reduction in uncertainty about $\\theta$ measured using the\n        Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the prior and posterior\n        distributions. Given the current posterior distribution\n        $P(\\theta | \\mathcal{D})$ and a possible observation\n        $y \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ (where $y = 1$ if $x_1$ is preferred over\n        $x_2$, and $y = 0$ otherwise), the expected information gain is: $$\\begin{aligned}\n    \\mathbb{E}[\\text{IG}(x_1, x_2)] = &P(y=1 | x_1, x_2, \\theta) D_{\\text{KL}}\\left( P(\\theta | y = 1, \\mathcal{D}) \\parallel P(\\theta | \\mathcal{D}) \\right) \\\\+ \n    &P(y=0 | x_1, x_2, \\theta) D_{\\text{KL}}\\left( P(\\theta | y = 0, \\mathcal{D}) \\parallel P(\\theta | \\mathcal{D}) \\right)\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\n        Derive this expression for the expected information gain of\n        selecting the pair $(x_1, x_2)$ for a preference query. Start by\n        explaining how the KL divergence measures the information gain,\n        and break down the expectation over the possible outcomes of the\n        query.\n\n    (ii) **Simplifying the KL Divergence (Written, 4 points).** Assuming\n         the prior and posterior distributions over $\\theta$ are\n         Gaussian (i.e., $P(\\theta) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\Sigma)$ and\n         $P(\\theta | \\mathcal{D}) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu', \\Sigma')$),\n         show that the KL divergence between the Gaussian posterior and\n         prior simplifies to: $$\\begin{aligned}\n        D_{\\text{KL}}\\left( \\mathcal{N}(\\mu', \\Sigma') \\parallel \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\Sigma) \\right) &= \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\text{tr}(\\Sigma^{-1} \\Sigma') + (\\mu' - \\mu)^\\top \\Sigma^{-1} (\\mu' - \\mu)\\right.\\\\\n        &\\left.- d + \\log\\left( \\frac{\\det(\\Sigma)}{\\det(\\Sigma')} \\right) \\right).\n        \\end{aligned}$$\n\n    (iii) **Approximate Information Gain for a Linear Model (Written, 4\n          points).** In the case of a linear model with Gaussian priors\n          on $\\theta$, assume that the posterior distribution\n          $P(\\theta | \\mathcal{D}) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\Sigma)$ is\n          updated using Bayes' rule after each observation. The\n          likelihood of observing a preference $y$ is logistic, which\n          does not conjugate with the Gaussian prior. However, for the\n          purposes of this question, assume that after each query, the\n          posterior mean $\\mu'$ and covariance $\\Sigma'$ can be updated\n          using an approximation method such as Laplace's approximation.\n\n          Using these assumptions, compute the expected information gain\n          for a specific query $(x_1, x_2)$ in closed form. You may\n          express the information gain in terms of the updated mean\n          $\\mu'$ and covariance $\\Sigma'$ after observing the preference\n          outcome.\n\n    (iv) **Laplace Approximation for Posterior (Written, 4 points).**\n         The Laplace approximation for the posterior is given by $$\\begin{aligned}\n    \\mu'=\\arg \\min_\\theta -\\log P(\\theta | \\mathcal{D})\\\\\n    \\Sigma'^{-1}=\\nabla_\\theta\\nabla_\\theta -\\log P(\\theta|\\mathcal{D})|_{\\theta=\\mu'}\n\\end{aligned}$$ \n         In our scenario with the Bradley-Terry model\n         for likelihood, simplify $-\\log P(\\theta | \\mathcal{D})$ and\n         its Hessian ignoring the normalization constant.\n\n(b) **Active Learning Algorithm (25 points)** In this section, you will\n    implement an active learning algorithm for selecting the most\n    informative queries using the expected information gain criterion.\n\n    (i) **(Coding, 4 points).** Implement `kl_divergence_gaussians` in\n        `active_learning/main.py`.\n\n    (ii) **(Coding, 4 points).** Following your derived Laplace\n         approximation, implement `negative_log_posterior`.\n\n    (iii) **(Coding, 4 points).** Implement `compute_hessian` that is\n          used to obtain the inverse of the covariance matrix.\n\n    (iv) **(Coding, 3 points).** Implement `expected_information_gain`.\n\n    (v) **(Coding, 4 points).** Finally, implement `active_learning`.\n\n    (vi) **(Coding + Written, 6 points).** Plot the $L^2$ norm of the\n         covariance matrix for each loop of the active learning loop.\n         Additionally, on the same plot, implement a random baseline and\n         plot its $L^2$ covariance matrix norm. The random baseline\n         should randomly select a point in the dataset and not use any\n         acquisition function. Interpret your plot and use it to compare\n         the two methods.\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"code\"}\n\n::: {#df7119e2 .cell execution_count=9}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\nfrom torch.optim import Adam\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_classification\n\nclass LogisticActiveLearning:\n    def __init__(self, test_size=0.2):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initializes LogisticActiveLearning model, sets device, and prepares data.\n        \n        Args:\n        -

The Bradley-Terry model is a logistic regression\nmodel used for paired comparison data. Given two items $x_1$ and $x_2$,\nthe probability that item $x_1$ is preferred over $x_2$ is modeled as:\n\n$$P(x_1 \\succ x_2 | \\theta) = \\frac{e^{\\theta^\\top x_1}}{e^{\\theta^\\top x_1} + e^{\\theta^\\top x_2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{\\theta^\\top (x_2 - x_1)}}$$\n\nwhere $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ represents the unknown model parameters,\nand $x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ are the feature vectors associated with\nthe two items. D-optimal design aims to maximize the determinant of the\nFisher information matrix, thus minimizing the volume of the confidence\nellipsoid for the estimated parameters. In this exercise, you will\nanalyze D-optimal designs for this model.\n\n(a) **Fisher Information Matrix for the Bradley-Terry Model (12\n    points)**\n\n    (i) **(Written, 6 points).** Derive the Fisher information matrix\n        for the Bradley-Terry model at a design point $(x_1, x_2)$. Show\n        that the Fisher information matrix at a design point is:\n        $$I(x_1, x_2, \\theta) = w(x_1, x_2, \\theta) (x_1 - x_2)(x_1 - x_2)^\\top,$$\n        where $w(x_1, x_2, \\theta)$ is a weight function given by:\n        $$w(x_1, x_2, \\theta) = \\frac{e^{\\theta^\\top x_1} e^{\\theta^\\top x_2}}{\\left(e^{\\theta^\\top x_1} + e^{\\theta^\\top x_2}\\right)^2} =\\sigma'(\\theta^\\top (x_1-x_2)).$$\n        $\\sigma'$ is the derivative of the sigmoid function.\n\n    (ii) **(Coding, 6 points).** Implement `fisher_matrix` in\n         `d_optimal/main.py` based on the derived expression.\n\n(b) **D-optimal Design Criterion (18 points)**\n\n    (i) **(Coding, 11 points).** In the context of the Bradley-Terry\n        model, a D-optimal design maximizes the determinant of the\n        Fisher information matrix. Suppose we have a set of candidate\n        items $\\{x_1, \\dots, x_n\\}$, and we can choose $N$ comparisons\n        to make. Formally, the D-optimal design maximizes:\n        $$\\det\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^N w(x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \\theta) (x_{i1} - x_{i2})(x_{i1} - x_{i2})^\\top \\right),$$\n        where $(x_{i1}, x_{i2})$ denotes a pair of compared items in the\n        design. Implement a greedy algorithm to approximate the\n        D-optimal design. Given a set of $n$ items and their feature\n        vectors $\\{x_1, \\dots, x_n\\}$, your task is to iteratively\n        select the pair of items $(x_{i1}, x_{i2})$ that maximizes the\n        determinant of the Fisher information matrix. Please implement\n        `greedy_fisher`. Note that the setup in the code assumes we have\n        a dataset of all possible differences between pairs of items as\n        opposed to directly selecting the pairs.\n\n    (ii) **(Written + Coding, 7 points).** Notice that\n         `posterior_inv_cov` uses a Laplace approximation for the\n         posterior centered around the ground truth weights after\n         labeling the chosen points. However, it turns out this\n         approximation doesn't actually depend on the labels when taking\n         the Hessian. Please run the file `d_optimal/main.py` and attach\n         a plot of the norm of the covariance matrix of the posterior.\n         What difference do you observe between greedy and random\n         sampling?

What are the advantages of using a GP over a linear model in\n        this context?\n\n    (ii) **(Written, 2 points).** Suppose we observe pairwise\n         comparisons between classifiers, where a user provides feedback\n         on which classifier they prefer based on the unknown metric\n         $\\phi$. Given two classifiers with confusion matrices\n         $C_1 = (\\text{FP}_1, \\text{FN}_1)$ and\n         $C_2 = (\\text{FP}_2, \\text{FN}_2)$, the user indicates their\n         relative preference. Let the observed preference be modeled by\n         Bradley-Terry as: $$\\Pr(C_1 \\succ C_2) = \\sigma(\\phi(\\text{FP}_1, \\text{FN}_1) - \\phi(\\text{FP}_2, \\text{FN}_2)).$$ \n         where we view $\\phi$ as the reward function.\n         How does this likelihood affect the posterior inference in the\n         GP? Where does it introduce additional complexity?\n\n    (iii) **(Written + Coding, 6 points).** Given a set of observed\n          pairwise comparisons, derive the posterior distribution over\n          the latent function values $\\phi$ given a set of confusion\n          matrices preferences using Bayes' rule. Express the posterior\n          distribution in terms of the GP prior and the pairwise\n          likelihood function. You do not need to include the\n          normalization constant. Implement the likelihood function in\n          `loglik_from_preferences`.\n\n(b) **Elliptical Slice Sampling for Posterior Inference (20 points)**\n\n    (i) **(Written, 3 points).** Read\n        <https://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/murray10a/murray10a.pdf>.\n        Elliptical slice sampling is a sampling method used to generate\n        samples from the posterior distribution of a Gaussian Process.\n        Explain the key idea behind elliptical slice sampling and why it\n        is well-suited for sampling from the GP posterior in this\n        context.\n\n    (ii) **(Coding, 10 points).** Implement elliptical slice sampling in\n         `npme/elliptical_sampler.py` by following Figure 2 in the\n         paper.\n\n    (iii) **(Written, 3 points).** Run the algorithm on a synthetic\n          preference dataset of confusion matrices with pairwise\n          preferences. The synthetic data will be constructed using the\n          metric\n          $$\\phi_{\\text{true}}(\\text{FP}, \\text{FN}) = \\log(1 + \\text{FP}) + \\log(1 + \\text{FN}),$$\n          which captures the idea that the human oracle perceives both\n          false positives and false negatives in a way that flattens out\n          as these values increase (i.e., marginal increases in FP and\n          FN have diminishing effects on the performance metric).\n          Explain the psychological motivation behind this non-linear\n          function. Why might a logarithmic form be appropriate for\n          modeling human perception of classification errors?\n\n          Run the file `npme/main.py` and attach the plot of\n          $\\phi_{\\text{true}}$ vs your elicited metric. What do you\n          notice in the plot?\n\n    (iv) **(Written + Coding, 4 points).** Once the GP has been trained\n         and posterior samples of the function\n         $\\phi(\\text{FP}, \\text{FN})$ have been obtained, how can we\n         evaluate the quality of the elicited metric? Propose a method\n         to evaluate how well the elicited metric $\\phi$ aligns with the\n         user's true preferences and implement it in\n         `evaluate_elicited_metric` taking into the plot you saw in part\n         (iii).\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"code\"}\n\n::: {#a268cef2 .cell execution_count=12}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom typing import Callable\nimport numpy as np\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\n\nclass EllipticalSliceSampler:\n    def __init__(self,\n                 prior_cov: np.ndarray,\n                 loglik: Callable):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initializes the Elliptical Slice Sampler.\n        \n        Args:\n        - prior_cov (np.ndarray): Prior covariance matrix.\n        - loglik (Callable): Log-likelihood function.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.prior_cov = prior_cov\n        self.loglik = loglik\n\n        self._n = prior_cov.shape[0]  # Dimensionality of the space\n        self._chol = np.linalg.cholesky(prior_cov)  # Cache Cholesky decomposition\n\n        # Initialize state by sampling from prior\n        self._state_f = self._chol @ np.random.randn(self._n)\n\n    def _indiv_sample(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Main algorithm for generating an individual sample using Elliptical Slice Sampling.\n        \"\"\"\n        f = self._state_f  # Previous state\n        nu = self._chol @ np.random.randn(self._n)  # Sample from prior for the ellipse\n        log_y = self.loglik(f) + np.log(np.random.uniform())  # Log-likelihood threshold\n\n        theta = np.random.uniform(0., 2 * np.pi)  # Initial proposal angle\n        theta_min, theta_max = theta - 2 * np.pi, theta  # Define bracketing interval\n\n        # Main loop: Accept sample if it meets log-likelihood threshold; otherwise, shrink the bracket.\n        while True:\n            # YOUR CODE HERE (~10 lines)\n            # 1.
