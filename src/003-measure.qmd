## Active Preference Learning
### Introduction to Active Learning

In real-world scenarios, data is often scarce, and acquiring labeled data can be expensive. 
Active learning is a machine learning paradigm that aims to reduce the amount of labeled data 
required to train a model to achieve high accuracy. Active learning algorithms iteratively 
select an input datapoint for an oracle (e.g., a human annotator) to label such that when the 
label is observed, the model improves the most. The goal of AL algorithms is to minimize the number of labels
required to achieve a desired level of performance. This technique is particularly useful in
situations where labeling data is expensive, time-consuming, or requires domain expertise.

There are two primary setups in active learning:

-   **Pool-based:** The model selects samples from a large unlabeled pool of data. 
  For example, a model for text classification selects the most uncertain texts from a large pool 
  to ask a human annotator to label.

-   **Stream-based:** The model receives samples sequentially (one sample at a time) and decides 
  whether to label them. The data is gone if the decision maker decides not to label it. 
  For example, a system monitoring sensor data decides on-the-fly whether new sensor readings are 
  valuable enough to label.

A common AL process is shown in @fig-schema:

-   Current model trained on current dataset $\mathcal{D}$, potential points $\tilde{x}_1 \dots \tilde{x}_m$ 
are being investigated. AL will choose one of them to add to the dataset. 

-   Relative to the model, a proxy highlights the relative value of each point to model improvement 
$(v(\tilde{x}_1) \dots v(\tilde{x}_m) )$. A naive proxy is the model's uncertainty about the point.

-   The cycle repeats until we collect enough data or the model is good enough.

![The current model is trained on the current data set $\mathcal{D}$. 
Potential points $\tilde{x}_1, \ldots, \tilde{x}_m$ are being investigated, 
and one of them will be chosen and added to the data set. A proxy highlights 
the relative value of each point in terms of improving the model, denoted by 
$v(\tilde{x}_1), \ldots, v(\tilde{x}_m)$. The point with the highest value is 
selected and added to $\mathcal{D}$. This cycle repeats until enough data has 
been collected or the model is good enough.](Figures/active_learning_schema.png){#fig-schema width="40%"}

Active learning has been successfully applied to various domains to enhance real-world systems, 
including computer vision, natural language processing, and recommender systems. For example, active 
learning can improve the computer vision models used in autonomous vehicles [@AL_app_autonomous], 
here driving scenes can take infinitely many forms, making it impossible to gather an exhaustive dataset. 
Instead, probing a model to understand what type of data it would benefit from is more practical. 
In robotics, autonomous agents may query humans when unsure how to act or when facing new situations 
[@AL_app_robotics]. In this field, collecting data often incurs significant financial and time costs: 
the robot must act in real-time in the real world, and while parallelization is possible, being strategic 
about which examples to collect can best benefit the model. In meteorology, active learning can help decide 
where to place additional sensors for weather predictions [@AL_app_sensors]. Sensor placement involves 
deploying teams to remote locations and expensive construction for an extra data point. Choosing these 
locations and allocating resources wisely is of interest to governments and businesses. Active learning 
could also be employed to select data for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for specific downstream 
tasks [@AL_app_LLMs]. In this context, it might be difficult to fully describe an NLP task one might want an 
LLM to solve. Often, instead of defining a task via a dataset of examples, it may be easier for a human to 
interact with the LLM for a specific use case, identify gaps in the model, and address those using active learning.


### Introduction to Active Preference Learning

Consider the scenario where a robot is being trained to assist individuals with feeding. How can such a robot be 
effectively taught to perform necessary tasks, such as determining the appropriate distance to reach, detecting the 
location of a person's mouth, and, most importantly, understanding human preferences? Typically, robots learn by 
observing human demonstrations, replicating the ways a person performs the task. However, this method poses 
significant challenges. Expert demonstrations are often limited, and training a supervised learning model would 
require vast amounts of demonstration data, which is difficult to obtain at scale. Moreover, demonstrations tend 
to be variable, reflecting the actions of individual humans, making the data collection process inconsistent. To 
address these limitations, alternative approaches have been proposed, such as using pairwise comparisons, where 
humans evaluate two action trajectories to determine the superior one, or employing physical corrections, in which 
reward functions are learned through human-robot interactions, with humans guiding the robot’s actions during the task.

Active learning algorithms can be employed in preference learning tasks, such as the previously mentioned example, 
where the objective is to develop a model that aligns with human preferences while minimizing the need for extensive 
labeled data or reducing the high cost of annotations. This chapter will explore the theoretical foundations of 
pairwise comparisons and active preference learning, along with extensions to these methods that address known 
limitations. Practical examples where these approaches prove beneficial will also be discussed. Additionally, we 
will examine the role of LLMs in assisting robots through corrective feedback and highlight the applications of these techniques.


### Uncertainty Qualification

**Problem Setup**: In this section, we consider a binary classification problem. The model is trained on a small 
labeled dataset $\mathcal{D} = \{(x_1, y_1), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)\}$, where $x_i$ represents the input data and $y_i$ 
is the corresponding label. The model is uncertain about the class labels of some data points and can query an oracle 
to obtain the true labels of these data points. The goal is to minimize the number of queries to the oracle while 
maximizing the model's performance.

Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is a critical aspect of active learning that allows models to evaluate the informativeness 
of new data points. In machine learning (ML), two primary types of uncertainty are often considered: epistemic and 
aleatoric uncertainty. **Epistemic uncertainty**, or model uncertainty, arises from a lack of knowledge and can be 
reduced by acquiring more data. This type of uncertainty is especially significant when the model lacks confidence 
due to insufficient or incomplete information in its training set. On the other hand, **aleatoric uncertainty**, or 
data uncertainty, stems from the inherent randomness within the data itself. Unlike epistemic uncertainty, aleatoric 
uncertainty cannot be reduced, even with additional data, as it reflects noise or unpredictability in the real 
data-generating process. Several approaches exist to quantify uncertainty in active learning, each with its strengths and limitations. 

**Bayesian methods**, such as Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) and Gaussian Processes (GPs), offer a principled way 
of estimating uncertainty by incorporating prior knowledge into the model. These approaches can generate meaningful 
uncertainty estimates that aid in choosing informative samples for labeling. However, they can become computationally 
prohibitive, especially for large and complex models, limiting their applicability in some practical scenarios.

Another common technique for uncertainty quantification is the use of **ensemble methods**, such as Random Forests or 
Gradient Boosting Machines. These methods involve training multiple models and combining their predictions to provide 
an estimate of uncertainty. Ensemble methods are relatively easy to implement and can give valuable insights into model 
uncertainty. However, they can be computationally expensive and may not always produce well-calibrated uncertainty 
estimates. Moreover, they do not integrate prior knowledge, which can be a disadvantage in certain applications.

**Conformal prediction methods** also provide a framework for estimating uncertainty by offering a measure of confidence 
in predictions based on the conformity of a given instance with the training data. While these methods are useful in 
some contexts, this book focuses primarily on the Bayesian approach due to its theoretical robustness and capacity to 
quantify uncertainty in a more comprehensive manner.


### Acquisition Function

Uncertainty quantification plays a vital role in **acquisition functions**, which are central to active learning strategies. 
These functions determine which samples are most valuable to label by evaluating their utility based on the model's 
current uncertainty estimates. Common acquisition functions include **uncertainty sampling** [@AL_uncertainty], 
which selects samples the model is least confident about, **query-by-committee** [@AL_committee], which utilizes a set 
of models to choose the most uncertain samples, and **Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD)** [@AL_BALD], 
which selects samples that maximize information gain by reducing model uncertainty. Through careful uncertainty quantification, 
acquisition functions guide the active learning process, improving the model's efficiency in learning from limited data. 
Other acquisition functions that can be employed include:

-   **Active Thompson Sampling** [@AL_exploreexploit]: This method leverages the Thompson Sampling algorithm to select a 
    posterior sample from the model's distribution and compute the expected utility of labeling using that sample. By doing so, 
    the algorithm balances exploration and exploitation, leading to effective active learning.

-   **Expected model change** [@AL_expmodelchange]: This approach focuses on labeling points that would have the most 
    impact on changing the current model parameters.

-   **Expected error reduction** [@AL_experrorredn]: Points that would most effectively reduce the model's generalization 
    error are labeled using this strategy.

-   **Variance reduction** [@AL_variance]: This approach labels points that would minimize output variance, which is one 
    component of error. By selecting points that reduce variability in the model's predictions, it aims to improve overall performance.

-   **User Centered Labeling Strategies** [@AL_usercentered]: This approach involves actively involving the user in 
    the labeling process by visualizing data through dimensionality reduction techniques. The user then provides labels 
    for the compiled data based on their domain expertise and preferences. This strategy leverages user input to improve 
    the quality and relevance of the labeled data.

-   **Querying from diverse subspaces or partitions** [@AL_partition]: When using a forest of trees as the underlying model, 
    the leaf nodes can represent overlapping partitions of the feature space. This strategy selects instances from non-overlapping 
    or minimally overlapping partitions for labeling.

-   **Conformal prediction** [@AL_conformal]: This method predicts that a new data point will have a label similar to old 
    data points in some specified way. The degree of similarity within the old examples is used to estimate the confidence 
    in the prediction.

-   **Mismatch-first farthest-traversal** [@AL_mismatch]: This strategy first prioritizes data points that are wrongly 
    predicted by the current model compared to the nearest-neighbor prediction. The second criterion is the distance to 
    previously selected data, with preference given to those that are farthest away. The goal is to optimize both the 
    correction of mispredictions and the diversity of the selected data.

#### Uncertainty Sampling {.unnumbered}
Uncertainty sampling [@AL_uncertainty] is a widely used acquisition function in active learning that selects data 
points for which the model exhibits the greatest uncertainty. This method aims to improve model performance by focusing 
labeling efforts on ambiguous samples, where additional information is likely to yield the greatest benefit. Let $x$ 
represent the input, and $p(y|x)$ the probability distribution of the output $y$ given $x$. Several acquisition strategies 
fall under uncertainty sampling, including **entropy sampling**, **margin sampling**, and **least confidence sampling**, 
each providing a unique measure of uncertainty.

-   **Entropy sampling** measures uncertainty by calculating the entropy of the predicted probability distribution. 
    The acquisition function is given by $\alpha(x) = - \sum_{y} p(y|x) \log p(y|x)$, with higher entropy values indicating 
    higher uncertainty.

-   **Margin sampling** focuses on the difference between the two highest predicted probabilities for a sample. The 
    acquisition function is given by $\alpha(x) = p(y_1|x) - p(y_2|x)$, where $y_1$ and $y_2$ are two most likely classes. 
    Smaller margins signify greater uncertainty.

-   **Least confidence sampling** measures uncertainty by identifying the sample with the lowest predicted probability 
    for its most likely class. The acquisition function is $\alpha(x) = 1 - p(y_{\text{max}}|x)$, where $y_{\text{max}}$ 
    is the class with the highest probability.

**Example:** Consider a binary classification problem with two classes $y_1$ and $y_2$. 
We have three samples $x_1, x_2, x_3$ and the corresponding predictive distributions are as follows:
$$\begin{aligned}
p(y_1|x_1) &= 0.6, \quad p(y_2|x_1) = 0.4\\
p(y_1|x_2) &= 0.3, \quad p(y_2|x_2) = 0.7\\
p(y_1|x_3) &= 0.8, \quad p(y_2|x_3) = 0.2
\end{aligned}$$ {#eq-eq3.1}

-   **Entropy Sampling** 
    +   $\alpha(x_1) = -0.6 \log (0.6) - 0.4 \log (0.4) = 0.29$
    +   $\alpha(x_2) = -0.3 \log (0.3) - 0.7 \log (0.7) = 0.27$
    +   $\alpha(x_3) = -0.8 \log (0.8) - 0.2 \log (0.2) = 0.22$

We would select $x_1$ for labeling as it has the highest entropy, indicating the model is most uncertain about its prediction at $x_1$.

-   **Margin Sampling** 
    +   $\alpha(x_1) = 0.6 - 0.4 = 0.2$
    +   $\alpha(x_2) = 0.7 - 0.3 = 0.4$
    +   $\alpha(x_3) = 0.8 - 0.2 = 0.6$

We would select $x_1$ for labeling as it has the smallest margin, indicating the model is most uncertain about the prediction at $x_1$.

-   **Least Confidence Sampling** 
    +   $\alpha(x_1) = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4$
    +   $\alpha(x_2) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3$
    +   $\alpha(x_3) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2$

We would select $x_1$ for labeling as it has the lowest confidence, indicating the model is most uncertain about the prediction at $x_1$.

In summary, uncertainty sampling methods, whether based on entropy, margin, or least confidence, help prioritize data 
points that the model struggles with the most. By focusing on these uncertain samples, the model can more efficiently 
improve its performance, making uncertainty sampling a key tool in active learning.

#### Query-by-Committee {.unnumbered}
Query-by-Committee [@AL_committee] is an active learning strategy where a committee of models selects samples for 
labeling based on the level of disagreement among the committee members. Several acquisition functions can be employed 
under this framework to quantify the disagreement:

-   **Vote Entropy:** The vote entropy measures the uncertainty based on how often the committee members vote for each class. 
    The acquisition function is defined as $\alpha(x) = \mathbb{H}\left[\frac{V(y)}{C}\right]$, where $V(y)$ is the number of 
    votes for class $y$ and $C$ is the number of committee members.

-   **Consensus Entropy:** This acquisition function measures the entropy of the average probability distribution across committee 
    members. It is given by $\alpha(x) = \mathbb{H}[P_C(y|x)]$, where $P_C(y|x)$ is the average probability distribution for sample 
    $x$ across all committee members.

-   **KL Divergence:** The KL divergence quantifies the disagreement by comparing the probability distribution of each 
    committee member to the average distribution. The acquisition function is given by 
    $\alpha(x) = \frac{1}{C} \sum_{c=1}^{C} D_{KL}[P_c(y|x) || P_C(y|x)]$, 
    where $P_c(y|x)$ is the probability distribution of committee member $c$ and $P_C(y|x)$ is the average distribution 
    across the committee.

**Example:** Consider a binary classification problem with two classes $y_1$ and $y_2$. We have three committee members and three samples: $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$. The predictive distributions for each committee member are given below:

|   $x$ | $p_1(y_1 \vert \cdot)$  | $p_1(y_2 \vert \cdot)$ | $p_2(y_1 \vert \cdot)$ | $p_2(y_2 \vert \cdot)$ | $p_3(y_1 \vert \cdot)$ | $p_3(y_2 \vert \cdot)$ |
| ----- | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| $x_1$ | 0.6                   | 0.4                   | 0.7                   | 0.3                   | 0.3                   | 0.7                   |
| $x_2$ | 0.3                   | 0.7                   | 0.4                   | 0.6                   | 0.4                   | 0.6                   |
| $x_3$ | 0.8                   | 0.2                   | 0.9                   | 0.1                   | 0.7                   | 0.3                   |

**Query-by-Committee: Vote Entropy**

-   For sample $x_1$, the votes for $y_1$ and $y_2$ are $V(y_1) = 2$ and $V(y_2) = 1$. The vote entropy is $\alpha(x_1) = - \frac{2}{3} \log (\frac{2}{3}) - \frac{1}{3} \log (\frac{1}{3}) = 0.28$.
-   For sample $x_2$, the votes are $V(y_1) = 0$ and $V(y_2) = 3$, resulting in vote entropy $\alpha(x_2) = 0$.
-   For sample $x_3$, the votes are $V(y_1) = 3$ and $V(y_2) = 0$, resulting in vote entropy $\alpha(x_3) = 0$.

Thus, sample $x_1$ would be selected for labeling as it has the highest vote entropy, indicating the greatest disagreement among the committee members.

**Query-by-Committee: Consensus Entropy**

The first step is to compute the consensus probability of each class for each sample:

-   For $x_1$, $p_c(y_1|x_1) = \frac{0.6 + 0.7 + 0.3}{3} = 0.53$ and $p_c(y_2|x_1) = \frac{0.4 + 0.3 + 0.7}{3} = 0.47$.
-   For $x_2$, $p_c(y_1|x_2) = \frac{0.3 + 0.4 + 0.4}{3} = 0.37$ and $p_c(y_2|x_2) = \frac{0.7 + 0.6 + 0.6}{3} = 0.63$.
-   For $x_3$, $p_c(y_1|x_3) = \frac{0.8 + 0.9 + 0.7}{3} = 0.8$ and $p_c(y_2|x_3) = \frac{0.2 + 0.1 + 0.3}{3} = 0.2$.

Next, we compute the entropy of these consensus probabilities:

-   For $x_1$, $\mathbb{H}[p_c(y|x_1)] = -0.53 \log (0.53) - 0.47 \log (0.47) = 0.30$.
-   For $x_2$, $\mathbb{H}[p_c(y|x_2)] = -0.37 \log (0.37) - 0.63 \log (0.63) = 0.29$.
-   For $x_3$, $\mathbb{H}[p_c(y|x_3)] = -0.8 \log (0.8) - 0.2 \log (0.2) = 0.22$.

Thus, $x_1$ would be selected for labeling as it has the highest consensus entropy, indicating the highest level of disagreement among the committee members.

#### Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement {.unnumbered}

Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD) [@AL_BALD] selects the samples for which the model expects to gain the most Shannon information when corresponding labels are observed:

$$
\mathbb{I}(\theta; y|x, \mathcal{D}) = \mathbb{H}[p(y|x, \mathcal{D})] - \mathbb{E}_{p(\theta | \mathcal{D})} [\mathbb{H}[p(y|x, \theta, \mathcal{D})]]
$$ {#eq-eq3.2}

where $\mathbb{H}[\cdot]$ denotes entropy. When there is significant disagreement among models, the predictive entropy (the first term) will be large, while the expected entropy (the second term) will be smaller. This difference represents the degree to which the models disagree. BALD selects points where this disagreement is maximized.


-   To compute the first term, we can derive the following expression:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{H}[p(y|x, \mathcal{D})] &= \mathbb{H}\left[\int_{\theta} p(y|x, \theta, \mathcal{D}) p(\theta | \mathcal{D}) d\theta\right]\\
&\approx \mathbb{H}\left[\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} p(y|x, \theta_i, \mathcal{D})\right]\\
&= \mathbb{H}\left[\overline{p}(y|x, \mathcal{D})\right]
\end{aligned}$$ {#eq-eq3.3}

-   To compute the second term, we can derive the following expression:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{E}_{p(\theta|\mathcal{D})} [\mathbb{H}[p(y|x, \theta, \mathcal{D})]] &= \mathbb{E}_{p(\theta|\mathcal{D})} \left[ - \sum_{y} p(y|x, \theta, \mathcal{D}) \log p(y|x, \theta, \mathcal{D}) \right] \\
&\approx - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( \sum_{y} p(y|x, \theta_i, \mathcal{D}) \log p(y|x, \theta_i, \mathcal{D}) \right)
\end{aligned}$$ {#eq-eq3.4}


**Example:** Consider a binary classification problem with two classes, $y_1$ and $y_2$. We have two samples, $x_1$ and $x_2$, and the model’s predictive distributions are as follows:

- **First-time inference** (with $\theta_1 \sim p(\theta | \mathcal{D})$):
  $$
  p(y_1|x_1, \theta_1, \mathcal{D}) = 0.6, \quad p(y_2|x_1, \theta_1, \mathcal{D}) = 0.4
  $$ {#eq-eq3.5}
  $$
  p(y_1|x_2, \theta_1, \mathcal{D}) = 0.4, \quad p(y_2|x_2, \theta_1, \mathcal{D}) = 0.6
  $$ {#eq-eq3.6}

- **Second-time inference** (with $\theta_2 \sim p(\theta | \mathcal{D})$):
  $$
  p(y_1|x_1, \theta_2, \mathcal{D}) = 0.8, \quad p(y_2|x_1, \theta_2, \mathcal{D}) = 0.2
  $$ {#eq-eq3.7}
  $$
  p(y_1|x_2, \theta_2, \mathcal{D}) = 0.5, \quad p(y_2|x_2, \theta_2, \mathcal{D}) = 0.5
  $$ {#eq-eq3.8}

**Solution:**

**Step 1:** Compute the entropy of the model's predictive distribution for each sample:

-   $\overline{p}_{\theta}(y_1|x_1, \theta, \mathcal{D}) = 0.7$
-   $\overline{p}_{\theta}(y_2|x_1, \theta, \mathcal{D}) = 0.3$
-   $\overline{p}_{\theta}(y_1|x_2, \theta, \mathcal{D}) = 0.45$
-   $\overline{p}_{\theta}(y_2|x_2, \theta, \mathcal{D}) = 0.55$

Now, we compute the entropy for each sample using the formula:

$$
\mathbb{H}[p(y|x, \mathcal{D})] = - p(y_1|x, \mathcal{D}) \log(p(y_1|x, \mathcal{D})) - p(y_2|x, \mathcal{D}) \log(p(y_2|x, \mathcal{D}))
$$ {#eq-eq3.9}

For $x_1$:

$$
\mathbb{H}[p(y|x_1, \mathcal{D})] = - 0.7 \log(0.7) - 0.3 \log(0.3) = 0.27
$$ {#eq-eq3.10}

For $x_2$:

$$
\mathbb{H}[p(y|x_2, \mathcal{D})] = - 0.45 \log(0.45) - 0.55 \log(0.55) = 0.30
$$ {#eq-eq3.11}

**Step 2:** Compute the expected entropy of the model's predictive distribution for each sample.

For $x_1$:

-   $\mathbb{H}_{\theta_1}[p(y|x_1, \theta, \mathcal{D})] = -0.6 \log(0.6) - 0.4 \log(0.4) = 0.29$
-   $\mathbb{H}_{\theta_2}[p(y|x_1, \theta, \mathcal{D})] = -0.8 \log(0.8) - 0.2 \log(0.2) = 0.22$

Average the results:

$$
\mathbb{E}_{p(\theta|\mathcal{D})}[\mathbb{H}[p(y|x_1, \theta, \mathcal{D})]] \approx \frac{0.29 + 0.22}{2} = 0.255
$$ {#eq-eq3.12}

For $x_2$:

-   $\mathbb{H}_{\theta_1}[p(y|x_2, \theta, \mathcal{D})] = -0.4 \log(0.4) - 0.6 \log(0.6) = 0.29$
-   $\mathbb{H}_{\theta_2}[p(y|x_2, \theta, \mathcal{D})] = -0.5 \log(0.5) - 0.5 \log(0.5) = 0.30$

Average the results:

$$
\mathbb{E}_{p(\theta|\mathcal{D})}[\mathbb{H}[p(y|x_2, \theta, \mathcal{D})]] \approx \frac{0.29 + 0.30}{2} = 0.295
$$ {#eq-eq3.13}

**Step 3:** Compute the BALD score for each sample.

The BALD score $\alpha(x)$ is the difference between the predictive entropy and the expected entropy:

For $x_1$:

$$
\alpha(x_1) = \mathbb{H}[p(y|x_1, \mathcal{D})] - \mathbb{E}_{p(\theta|\mathcal{D})}[\mathbb{H}[p(y|x_1, \theta, \mathcal{D})]] = 0.27 - 0.255 = 0.015
$$ {#eq-eq3.14}

For $x_2$:

$$
\alpha(x_2) = \mathbb{H}[p(y|x_2, \mathcal{D})] - \mathbb{E}_{p(\theta|\mathcal{D})}[\mathbb{H}[p(y|x_2, \theta, \mathcal{D})]] = 0.30 - 0.295 = 0.005
$$ {#eq-eq3.15}

We would select $x_1$ for labeling since it has the highest BALD score, indicating that labeling $x_1$ will provide the most information gain for the model.

### Active Learning by Variance Reduction

Active Learning by Variance Reduction [@AL_variance] is an algorithm designed to select the next data point for labeling 
based on the anticipated reduction in the model's variance. The objective is to identify the point $\tilde{x} \sim p(x)$ 
that, when labeled ($y(\tilde{x})$), will most effectively decrease the model's variance. To quantify the expected error 
at a given input $x$, we can mathematically express it as follows:

$$
\mathbb{E}_{\hat{y} \sim p(\hat{y} | \mathcal{D}; x), y \sim p(y|x)} (\hat{y} - y)^2
$$ {#eq-eq3.16}

In @eq-eq3.16, $\hat{y}$ represents the model's prediction, while $y$ denotes the true label corresponding 
to the input $x$. This formulation captures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values, 
providing a measure of the model's accuracy. Utilizing concepts from bias-variance decomposition as outlined in the 
literature [@bias_variance_orig_paper], we can expand the expected error term. The expansion is given by:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{E}_{\hat{y} \sim p(\hat{y} | \mathcal{D}; x), y \sim p(y|x)} (\hat{y} - y)^2 &= \mathbb{E}_{\hat{y}, y}[(\hat{y} - \mathbb{E}[y|x]) + (\mathbb{E}[y|x] - y)]^2 \\
&= \mathbb{E}_{\hat{y}, y} [(y - \mathbb{E}[y|x])^2]\\
&+ 2\mathbb{E}_{\hat{y}, y} [(\hat{y} - \mathbb{E}[y|x])(\mathbb{E}[y|x] - y)]\\
&+ \mathbb{E}_{\hat{y}, y}(\hat{y} - \mathbb{E}[y|x])^2
\end{aligned}$$ {#eq-eq3.17}

In @eq-eq3.17, the first term represents the variance of the true label $y$, the second term evaluates to zero, 
and the third term accounts for the variance of the model's prediction $\hat{y}$. 
To clarify why the second term is zero, we note that:

$$
\mathbb{E}_{\hat{y}, y}[\mathbb{E}[y|x] - y] = 0
$$ {#eq-eq3.18}

This indicates that the expected deviation of the true label from its conditional mean is null, 
as $\mathbb{E}[y|x]$ is, by definition, the average of $y$ given $x$. Focusing on the third term, we derive it as follows:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{E}_{\hat{y}, y}(\hat{y} - \mathbb{E}[y|x])^2 &= \mathbb{E}_{\hat{y}, y}[(\hat{y} - \mathbb{E}_{\hat{y}}[\hat{y}] + \mathbb{E}_{\hat{y}}[\hat{y}] - \mathbb{E}[y|x])^2] \\
&= \mathbb{E}_{\hat{y}, y}[(\hat{y} - \mathbb{E}_{\hat{y}}[\hat{y}])^2] + (\mathbb{E}_{\hat{y}}[\hat{y}] - \mathbb{E}[y|x])^2
\end{aligned}$$ {#eq-eq3.19}

Here, $\mathbb{E}_{\hat{y}}[\hat{y}]$ represents the expected model prediction conditioned on the 
data $\mathcal{D}$ and input $x$. Combining the results of our analysis, we arrive at the total expected error as:

$$
\mathbb{E}_{y} [(y - \mathbb{E}[y|x])^2] + (\mathbb{E}_{\hat{y}} [\hat{y} - \mathbb{E}[y|x]] )^2 + \mathbb{E}_{\hat{y}} [(\hat{y} - \mathbb{E}_{\hat{y}}[\hat{y}])^2]
$$ {#eq-eq3.20}

In this equation, the first term signifies the variance of the true label, which remains constant for 
a given $x$. The second term captures the bias of the model, reflecting how much the average model prediction 
deviates from the expected true label. The third term quantifies the model's uncertainty concerning the selected input $x$.

Referring to [@AL_variance], we can denote the uncertainty term as:

$$
\sigma^2_{\hat{y}} (x | \mathcal{D}) = \mathbb{E}_{\hat{y}} [(\hat{y} - \mathbb{E}_{\hat{y}}[\hat{y}])^2]
$$ {#eq-eq3.21}

This term explicitly represents the variance of the model predictions at the input $x$ given the dataset 
$\mathcal{D}$. More explicitly, it can be expressed as:

$$
\sigma^2_{\hat{y}} (x | \mathcal{D}) =  \mathbb{E}_{\hat{y} \sim p(\hat{y} | \mathcal{D}; x)} [(\hat{y} - \mathbb{E}_{\hat{y} \sim p(\hat{y} | \mathcal{D}; x)}[\hat{y}])^2]
$$ {#eq-eq3.22}

This formulation emphasizes the variability of the model's predictions around their mean, providing 
insights into the model's reliability in its estimations. The active learning by variance reduction algorithm 
can be summarized as follows:

1. **Sampling Candidates**: Sample candidate points $\tilde{x}_1, \dots, \tilde{x}_m$ from $p(x)$.
2. **Compute Expected Variance Reduction**: For each candidate $\tilde{x}_i$, compute:
$$
   \mathbb{E}_{p(x)} [\sigma^2_{\hat{y}} (x | \tilde{\mathcal{D}})]
$$ {#eq-eq3.23}
3.  **Select the Best Candidate**: Choose the point that minimizes expected variance reduction:
$$
   \tilde{x}^* = \arg\min_{\tilde{x}_i} \mathbb{E}_{p(x)} [\sigma^2_{\hat{y}} (x | \tilde{\mathcal{D}})]
$$ {#eq-eq3.24}
4. **Update Model**: Incorporate the newly labeled data and repeat the process.

While there is no general recipe for the number of iterations to
perform, one could imagine relying on some empirical measure like a loss
on left-out labelled data to gauge model improvement (as seen in [@fig-empirical:gauss; @fig-empirical:regress]). 
Intuitively, the size of the data
set and its relationship to the loss is intimately tied to the model
complexity which impacts its data-thirstiness.

We note to the reader that $P(X=x)$ is a distribution with
potentially-infinite support and the authors do not compute this
integral exactly. Instead, the computational estimate of that integral
consists of sampling several points $x \sim P(X=x)$ and averaging the
quantity inside the integral over these points until convergence using
Monte-Carlo sampling approaches (see [@monte-carlo]).

Arm2D (@fig-arm2D) is a kinematics problem where learner has to
predict the tip position of a robotic arm given a set of joint angles
$\mathbf{\theta_1}, \mathbf{\theta_2}$. In this analysis, the two models
seen in @fig-two_models, namely the Gaussian mixture model and
locally-weighted regression (LOESS).

The results shown in [@fig-empirical:gauss; @fig-empirical:regress] are intriguing. 
As expected, the variance of the learner decreases because the authors selected points to minimize 
expected variance. Additionally, we observe a related decrease in the mean square error (MSE) of both 
models as the dataset size increases. This is a notable outcome because the expected learner variance 
for these models can be computed accurately and efficiently relative to a new point. When integrated 
into the general active learning loop ([@fig-schema]), this significantly enhances model performance.

In the case of the locally-weighted regression model ([@fig-empirical:regress]), it is surprising 
that if points were chosen randomly, the MSE would be highly unstable, with sharp fluctuations. 
However, when active learning by variance reduction is applied, using expected learner variance 
as a proxy, the MSE decreases almost smoothly, aside from some initial instabilities.

### Active Learning in Ranking and Comparison

Many researchers have shown that making comparisons is easier and more convenient 
for users than assigning a specific score to each item. Individual comparisons yield a 
complete ranking over a set of $n$ objects $\Theta = (\theta_1, \theta_2, \cdots, \theta_n)$. 
This ranking is defined as a mapping $\sigma : \{1, \cdots, n\} \rightarrow \{1,\cdots, n\}$ 
that orders the set of objects $\Theta$. Specifically, for a single $\sigma$, 
$\sigma(\Theta) = \theta_{\sigma(1)} < \theta_{\sigma(2)} < \cdots < \theta_{\sigma(n-1)} < \theta_{\sigma(n)}$, 
where $\theta_{i} < \theta_{j}$ means that $\theta_{i}$ is rated lower than $\theta_{j}$.

For any $n$ elements to be ranked, there are $n!$ possible orderings that can result 
in the correct complete ranking. Given that a lower bound on sorting is $n\log n$, 
obtaining a guaranteed true rating over $n$ objects requires $n\log n$ pairwise 
comparisons if those comparisons are chosen at random. This number can be quite high 
and costly in many applications, especially since most ranking information comes from 
humans. The more comparisons they have to make, the more money and time is spent. This 
process can also be inefficient, as some comparisons provide more value to the learning 
process than others, making some comparisons a waste. This inefficiency can be detrimental 
in fields like psychology and market research, where comparisons are heavily utilized, and 
a faster process could offer significant benefits.

The reason the lower bound on the number of comparisons is $n\log n$ is that it assumes no 
prior information about the underlying space and field, so comparisons are chosen at random. 
However, leveraging the structures within the comparison space can provide more information 
about which comparisons are most valuable. For example, [@geo_paper] discusses how eye doctors 
have a wide range of options when assigning prescriptions for glasses, yet patients do not see 
them making many comparisons before deciding on the best option. This is because eye doctors 
incorporate domain knowledge into the process and only ask clients for comparisons when necessary. 
Applying similar knowledge in the ranking field leads to an active learning approach that 
selects data based on the relevance of a comparison query toward finding the final $\sigma(\Theta)$.

#### Geometric Approach to Comparisons {.unnumbered}

In this section, we will review the paper [@geo_paper], which explores active learning within data that can be embedded in a multi-dimensional space. In this context, comparisons between two different objects divide the space into halves, with one object being superior in each half. By leveraging such spatial information, the paper develops a geometric approach to ranking and active learning. This spatial information serves as the domain knowledge that informs which comparisons to perform to achieve the ranking.

For this application, the following terms are defined:

1. **$R^d$**: The space in which objects can be embedded.

2. **$\theta_1, \cdots,\theta_n$**: The objects, now representing their locations in $R^d$.

3. For each ranking $\sigma$, there is a reference point $r_{\sigma} \in R^d$, such that if, 
according to ranking $\sigma$, $\theta_{i} < \theta_{j}$ (object $i$ is worse than $j$),
 then $||\theta_i - r_{\sigma}|| < ||\theta_j - r_{\sigma}||$. In other words, object $i$ is 
 closer to the reference point $r_{\sigma}$ of the ranking than object $j$.

4. **$\Sigma_{n,d}$**: The set of all possible rankings of the $n$ objects that satisfy the
 embedding distances in the space $R^d$ as defined above. Note that not all possible rankings 
 will satisfy the embedding conditions, but multiple rankings might satisfy all those conditions.

5. For every ranking $\sigma$, there is $M_n(\sigma)$, the number of pairwise comparisons 
needed to identify the ranking. When comparisons are done at random, $E[M_n(\sigma)] = n\log n$. 
The paper [@geo_paper] examines this quantity to demonstrate that it can be reduced by incorporating 
spatial knowledge.

6. **$q_{i,j}$**: The query of comparison between objects $i$ and $j$.

#### Embedding Space {.unnumbered}

![Objects $\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3$ and queries in $R^2$. The
$r_\theta$ lies in the shaded region which represents
$\Sigma_{n,2}$(consistent with the labels of
$q_{1,2}, q_{1,3}, q_{2,3}$). The dotted (dashed) lines represent new
queries whose labels are (are not)
ambiguous.](Figures/SPACE.png){#fig-dim-space width="40%"}

To properly understand how to select the most 
valuable queries, it is essential to examine the space where the objects exist and how 
the queries divide that space to determine the proper rankings. For this example, 
in @fig-dim-space, the paper [@geo_paper] operates in $R^2$ space with three objects: 
$\theta_1$, $\theta_2$, and $\theta_3$. There are pairwise queries $q_{1,3}$, $q_{2,3}$, 
and $q_{1,2}$ between them, denoted by solid lines equidistant from the two objects they compare. 
These lines split the $R^2$ space into halves, with each half closer to one of the two objects. 
The paper colors the side of the worse object for each query in dark grey and takes the intersection 
of these halves, resulting in the dark grey region in the image. This region indicates 
$\Sigma_{n,2}$ since all points follow the embedding conditions. Specifically, for every point 
$r$ in the dark grey area, $||\theta_3 - r|| < ||\theta_2 - r|| < ||\theta_1 - r||$, 
meaning $\theta_3 < \theta_2 < \theta_1$. Thus, every point $r$ is one of the $r_\sigma$ representing 
their respective rankings $\sigma \in \Sigma_{n,2}$. In other words, the paper aims to have the 
reference points and dark grey region closest to the worst object and furthest from the best object.

The authors also denote the label for each query $q_{i,j}$, such as label $y_{i,j} = 1\{q_{i,j}\}$ 
(for example, $y_{1,2} = 0, y_{3,2} = 1$). This allows for deciding how to label new queries represented 
by dashed and dotted lines, depending on which objects each query compares. Focusing on the dotted line, 
called $q_{i,4}$, where $i={1,2,3}$, and considering potential locations of $\theta_4$, the line must be 
equidistant from one of the three objects in the picture and $\theta_4$, meaning $\theta_4$ can be placed 
in three different locations. If the query performed is $q_{2,4}$, then $\theta_4$ will be closer to the 
dark grey area than $\theta_2$, thus $y_{2,4} = 0$. However, if $q_{1,4}$ or $q_{3,4}$ are performed, 
$\theta_4$ will be further from the dark grey area than $\theta_1$ or $\theta_3$, meaning $y_{1,4} = y_{3,4} = 1$. 
In this case, the labels are contradictory and depend on which object they are compared with, making such 
a query $q_{i,4}$ ambiguous.

In contrast, the authors analyze the dashed line, called $q_{i,5}$, where $i={1,2,3}$, and consider 
potential locations of $\theta_5$. Since the line must be equidistant from one of the three objects in the 
picture and $\theta_5$, it can be placed in three different locations. If one of the three potential 
queries is performed, $\theta_5$ will be closer to the dark grey area than $\theta_1$, $\theta_2$, and 
$\theta_3$, meaning $y_{1,5} = y_{2,5} = y_{3,5} = 0$. In this case, all labels are the same regardless 
of which object is used, meaning such a query will not be contradictory, as all agree on the label.

The goal is to perform as many ambiguous queries as possible and skip non-ambiguous queries to decrease 
the total $M_n(\sigma)$. Intuitively, if there is contradictory information about a query, it needs to be 
erformed so that a human can clarify its direction. Conversely, if all sources of information from the domain 
space agree on the query's label, that information can be used without asking a human, incorporating the 
knowledge of the embedding distances.

Lastly, to consider the general case of the $R^d$ space, rather than discussing halves of the image, it 
is essential to discuss half-spaces. Similarly, consider the half-space that assigns a label of $1$ to 
the query and the half-space assigning a label of $0$. If both half-spaces exist, they have conflicting 
information on the query, making the query ambiguous. However, if one of the half-spaces does not exist, 
it means the other is the full space, representing consistency in the label assignment and a non-ambiguous query.

##### Algorithms for Ambiguous Query Selection {.unnumbered}

```pseudocode
#| label: alg-qsa
\begin{algorithm}
    \caption{Query Selection Algorithm}
    \begin{algorithmic}
        \State \textbf{input:} $n$ objects in $\mathbb{R}^d$
        \State \textbf{initialize:} objects $\theta_1, \dots, \theta_n$ in uniformly random order
        \For{$j=2, \dots, n$}
            \For{$i=1, \dots, j-1$}
                \If{$q_{i,j}$ is ambiguous}
                    \State request $q_{i,j}$'s label from reference
                \Else
                    \State impute $q_{i,j}$'s label from previously labeled queries
                \EndIf
            \EndFor
        \EndFor
        \State \textbf{output:} ranking of $n$ objects
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

The standard algorithm in @alg-qsa requests labels for $q_{i,j}$ if those queries 
are ambiguous; otherwise, it infers the information from prior comparisons and their labels.

It is important to demonstrate that the number of comparisons decreases. Specifically, 
[@geo_paper] shows that this algorithm has $E[M_n(\sigma)] = O(d\log n)$, where $d$ is the 
dimension of the space and $d < n$, which improves on the $O(n\log n)$ baseline. The proof 
can be studied in detail in the paper itself, but at a high level, it starts by reasoning 
about the probability of a query being ambiguous and a comparison being requested from a 
human, thus representing $M_n = \Sigma_{k=1}^{n-1}\Sigma_{i=1}^k 1\{Requestq_{i,k+1}\}$. 
For that, the authors define $Q(i,j)$, which represents the number of different rankings 
that exist for $i$ elements in $j$-dimensional space (e.g., $Q(1,d) = 1, Q(n,0) = 1, Q(n,1) = n!$). 
In that case, $|\Sigma_{n,d}| = Q(n,d)$. Further, using recurrence relations for $Q(i,j)$, the 
authors derive that $|\Sigma_{n,d}| = Q(n,d) = O(n^{2d})$, which is omitted here. Analogously, 
the authors define $P(i,j)$, which represents the number of rankings in $\Sigma_{n,d}$ that will 
still be possible with the addition of a new element $i+1$ to the ranking objects. Referring back 
to @fig-dim-space, $P(i,j)$ estimates how much of the dark grey area will still exist after making 
a query for $i+1$. As indicated there, the dotted line ambiguous query did not change the dark grey a
rea at all ($P(n,d) = Q(n,d)$), whereas the dashed non-ambiguous query would cut a piece from it 
($P(n,d) < Q(n,d)$). Thus, $Request q_{i,k+1} = P(k,d) / Q(k,d)$, so a higher value indicates 
more possible rankings and an ambiguous query that needs to be requested to obtain more useful 
information. With this in mind, the authors derive that $E[M_n(\sigma)] = O(d\log n)$, showing 
that fewer queries are needed for effective ranking.

The issue with this algorithm is that only one human provides the answers to the requested queries, 
which means it does not account for their biases. An alternative approach is a Robust Query Selection 
Algorithm (RQSA) [@geo_paper], which uses majority voting for every query to indicate the ground 
truth of the query's label. However, the authors consider that a group of people can still give 
incorrect or divided responses. If the votes for each answer are almost equal in number, the authors 
push that query to the end of the algorithm to see if it can become a non-ambiguous query with more 
information learned. If it does not, an odd number of voters is used to determine the final ranking.

  result of all comparisons, and $\hat{y}$ is the output of the RQSA.
:::

@fig-rand_n shows that the number of comparisons fits within the expected bounds, as
$\log|\Sigma_{n,d}| = \log(n^d) = d\log n$. To derive that graph,
authors [@geo_paper] sampled 100 random data points in a $R^d$ space,
where $d$ took on 10 different values as indicated on the graph. Each
dimension's experiments were repeated 25 times for consistency.

With regard to the accuracy and performance of the method, the authors
did a ranking experiment on 100 different audio signals, results of
which can be seen in @tbl-geo_acc. The ground truth labels came from humans,
indicated by $y$ in the table. That resulted in the existence of noise
and potential errors in the ground truth, which could influence the
performance of both the baseline algorithm that does all comparisons
($\tilde{y}$) and the Robust Query Selection Algorithm (RQSA) proposed
in @sec-QSA ($\hat{y}$). As can be seen in both 2 and
3-dimensional spaces RQSA performed worse by $8\%$ compared to the
baseline, which indicates that active learning that uses the domain
information can still be erroneous due to the inference of certain
comparisons that sometimes may not be entirely correct. However, as can
be seen by the upper part of @tbl-geo_acc,
significantly less queries were requested compared to the baseline,
which means that the approach can have a significant benefit at a cost
of slight loss in accuracy.

#### User Information as Domain Knowledge for Active Learning {#sec-geo_app .unnumbered}

An alternative source of domain knowledge could be users themselves, who
can indicate their uncertainty when it comes to comparing two objects.
Prior studies have shown [@unnoisy_humans] that when presented with only
two options when selecting which object is better, but not being able to
properly decide, users would get frustrated and tend to respond more
faultyly, creating noise and incorrect responses in the data. Through
feedback and other studies [@noisy_humans] it was determined that
presenting users with an option of indifference between the two objects
can remove those problems. Moreover, in connection to active learning,
the authors show that such an option helps to select more informative
queries since it provides more domain knowledge that can be used,
resulting in a decrease in the number of queries required.

For this problem, the following terms are defined:

1.  $c$ - a cost function that represents user preferences, and the
    result the model has to determine at the end of training. The
    preferred items will have lower costs, and less preferred ones will
    have higher costs. The goal is to determine this function with the
    fewest possible number of queries using active learning.

2.  $H$ - a set of hypotheses over the possible cost functions, where
    for each $h \in H$ there is a cost function $c_h$ associated with
    it.

3.  $h^*$ - a true hypothesis that the model needs to determine, which
    has cost $c_{h^*}$ associated with it

4.  $t(x,y)$ - a test performed to compare items $x$ and $y$ (the user
    is being asked to provide a response to which item is better). Those
    tests result in changes and adjustments to $H$ as more information
    is learned.

5.  $o(x,y)$ - observation or result of $t(x,y)$, where
    $o(x,y) \in \{x<y, x>y\}$

6.  $S = \{(t_1, o_1), (t_2, o_2),...,(t_m, o_m)\}$ - a sequence of $m$
    pairs of tests and observations

7.  $w(H|S)$ - probability mass of all hypotheses that are still
    consistent with the observations (similar to the dark grey area from
    @fig-dim-space and $Q(i,j)$ discussed in @sec-QSA. This means that if $h \in H$ is
    inconsistent with user responses received, it is removed from $H$.

With the key terms defined, let's consider the noiseless base setting
where users only have two options for response. Those components will
also later be translated to the setting with the third option so the
true cost function can be determined there. $w(H|S)$ is the sum of the
weights of all hypotheses that are still consistent with the evidence.
$$\begin{aligned}
    w(H|S) = \sum_{h \in H} w(h | S)\\
\end{aligned}$$  {#eq-eq3.25}
Each $w(h|S)$ is a probability of the evidence's
existence given such hypothesis: 
$$\begin{aligned}
    w(h|S) = p(S|h)
\end{aligned}$$  {#eq-eq3.26}
Such probability comes from the test-observation pairs
since they compose the set $S$. Moreover, each test is independent of
other tests, which gives:
 $$\begin{aligned}
    p(S|h) = \prod_{(t,o) \in S} p((t,o) | h)
\end{aligned}$$  {#eq-eq3.27}
In the noiseless setting, users will select an option
that minimizes their cost function (selecting more preferred items),
mathematically defined as: 
$$\begin{aligned}
    p((t, o = x) | h) = 
    \begin{cases}
        1 & c_h(x) < c_h(y)\\
        0 & else
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}$$ {#eq-prob_base}

**6.3.3.1 User Noise Modeling**

As has been discussed, users are not perfect evaluators and even get
frustrated if unable to select the better option. Prior work
[@unnoisy_humans] has shown that treating users as perfect can lead to
poor performance. That gave rise to accounting for noise in users'
responses, but a majority of such work applies the same noise to all
queries and all responses. While those led to great performance results
[@noisy_humans], they don't accurately reflect the real world, which
gave rise to the idea of creating query-based noise.

Effectively, for some of the queries it is important to incorporate the
fact that the user is unsure and noisy, but for others, if the user is
confident, noise in the response is not needed at all. For
comparison-based learning, this means that the noise is related to the
costs of the two items compared. Specifically for items $x$ and $y$, if
$c_{h^*}(x) \simeq c_{h^*}(y)$ then the items are hard to distinguish
for the user, so here it is preferred to incorporate user uncertainty
and noise. But if $c_{h^*}(x) >> c_{h^*}(y)$, the user will certainly
select $y$ and the other way around, which is where the noise is not
needed.

Query-dependent noise is also supported in the psychology literature,
which means that such an approach is more related to the real world. In
particular, psychologists talk about the Luce-Sheppard Choice rule
[@lus-shep] when talking about comparisons. This rule previously gave
rise to a logistic model based on the noise [@lus-log] where the
probability of observation for a given test is: 
$$\begin{aligned}
    p((t, o = x) | h) \propto exp(-\gamma * c_h(x))
\end{aligned}$$ {#eq-noise_model}

![User response model in the noiseless
setting](Figures/Noiseless probs.png){#fig-noiseless_1 width="100%"}

![User response with Luce Sheppard noise
model](Figures/Noise probs.png){#fig-noiseless_2 width="100%"}

[@fig-noiseless_1; @fig-noiseless_2] demonstrate the difference between the
noiseless setting and incorporating the Luce-Sheppard Choice rule. GBS
is the baseline model with only 2 response options, and CLAUS is the
model with the uncertainty option added. The figures show how
incorporating such noise influences and smoothes the probability
distribution of the user's response.

**6.3.3.2 User Uncertainty**

We will now discuss the functionality of CLAUS, which is an algorithm
designed by [@claus] that allows users to select an uncertain response
about the two options that they need to rank. The authors model such
uncertainty as $\epsilon$ and it is associated with each $c_h$, so now
every hypothesis $h$ is defined over a pair of $(c_h, \epsilon_h)$. It
is important to note that the goal is to still learn and maintain our
objective on $c$, $\epsilon$ is only necessary to model the users'
responses. The uncertainty relates to the cost function in the following
way: 
$$\begin{aligned}
    |c_h(x) - c_h(y)| < \epsilon_h
\end{aligned}$$  {#eq-eq3.30}
this means that the user is uncertain between items $x$
and $y$ and their cost difference is negligible such that the user is
not able to select which item is better. This in turn gives more
information about the real value of the two items, as a binary response
would indicate the user's preference towards one item, which will not be
real and will skew the cost functions.

This causes modifications of the problem set-up:

1.  For test $t(x,y)$ the observation will be
    $o(x,y) \in \{x<y, x>y, \tilde{xy}\}$, where $\tilde{xy}$ is the
    uncertain response.

2.  The probability distribution over the user's response
    ([@eq-prob_base]) will now be defined as:
$$\begin{aligned}
    p((t, o = x) | h) = 
    \begin{cases}
        1 & c_h(x) < c_h(y) - \epsilon_h\\
        0 & else
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}$$ {#eq-eq3.31}
    
$$\begin{aligned}
    p((t, o = \tilde{xy}) | h) = 
    \begin{cases}
        1 & |c_h(x) - c_h(y)|^2 < \epsilon_h^2\\
        0 & else
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}$$ {#eq-eq3.32}

This means the user confidently selects $x$ when it is better than $y$ by more than $\epsilon$, but if the squared
difference of the cost functions of two items is negligible by $\epsilon$ user will choose the indifferent option.

3.  Finally this also updates the noise model ([@eq-noise_model]):
$$\begin{aligned}
    p((t, o = x) | h) \propto \exp(-\gamma * [c_h(x) - c_h(y)])
\end{aligned}$$ {#eq-eq3.33}

$$\begin{aligned}
    p((t, o = \tilde{xy}) | h) \propto exp(-1/\epsilon_h^2 * [c_h(x) - c_h(y)]^2)
\end{aligned}$$ {#eq-eq3.34}

**6.3.3.3 Performance Analysis**

![CLAUS using equivalence classes. Each cost function $c$ corresponds to
an equivalence class (blue ellipse). Hypotheses (black dots) are
$\{c_h,\epsilon_h\}$ pairs. Hypotheses sharing a cost $c$ are said to be
inside the equivalence class of $c$. After performing a test and
receiving an observation, the evidence results in downweighting
connections among some of the hypotheses.](Figures/equiv.png){#fig-equiv_c width="60%"}

Before diving deeper into the comparisons of performance, it is
important to indicate that rather than predicting a specific pair
$(c_h, \epsilon_h)$, the algorithm focuses on predicting a group of
pairs that are similar to one another, otherwise called equivalence
class (@fig-equiv_c), which indicates not essentially different
hypothesis for the cost function and uncertainty. That information is
learned through each new test, as the algorithm updates the information
about $c$ and $\epsilon$ that distinguishes between the distinct $h$,
finding the equivalence groups among them. Moreover, the authors tweaked
the parameter responsible for the size of the equivalence class (how
many hypotheses can be grouped together at a time).

  : Performance of GBS and CLAUS with different labels for the uncertainty
:::

The first performance evaluation is done on the number of queries and
confirms that it decreases in @fig-claus_num.
The GBS model serves as the baseline, as it will do all of the
comparison queries using the binary response options. The CLAUS model is
measured over different values of $\epsilon$ on the x-axis and over
different sizes of the equivalence sets indicated by different shades of
blue. Figure shows that all variants of CLAUS use approximately 10 fewer
queries on average compared to GBS. Moreover, using bigger-sized
equivalence classes can further decrease the number of needed queries.
The most optimal $\epsilon \simeq 0.07$, after which higher $\epsilon$
does not provide any benefit.

Lastly, the authors considered the performance difference, which is
indicated in @tbl-claus_tab. For that authors used two different labels
for the uncertainty button in CLAUS, it was either labeled as \"About
Equal\" or \"Not Sure\" as those can provoke different responses and
feelings in users. Moreover, GBS and CLAUS-type responses were mixed in
the same set of questions to the user, which splits the metrics for both
in two as can be seen in @tbl-claus_tab.
The performance of CLAUS is lower by $3\%$ on average, indicating
similar results to @sec-geo_app, showing that a smaller number of queries can
still lead to a performance loss. However, the second column of @tbl-claus_tab
supports the information in @fig-claus_num,
as it also shows that 10 fewer queries were conducted on average.

### Active Preference-Based Learning of Reward Functions

Active learning can be essential in learning within dynamic systems and
environments. Say we have an agent in an environment, and we want it to
conform to a certain behavior as set by a human. How exactly do we go
about doing this? In a traditional RL setting, this is solved by a class
of algorithms under Inverse Reinforcement Learning. Techniques such as
VICE and GAIL attempt to learn a reward function that can distinguish
between states visited by the agent and states desired to be visited as
defined by a human. In effect, a human will demonstrate what it would
like the agent to do in the environment, and from there, learning is
done. However, what if humans do not precisely know how an agent should
optimally behave in an environment but still have some opinion on what
trajectories would be better than others? This is where a paper like
Active Preference-Based Learning of Reward Functions comes into the
picture. The paper aims to use human preferences to aid an agent's
learning within a dynamic system.

A dynamic system contains human input, robotic input, and an environment
state. The transitions between states is defined by $f_{HR}$, so that we
have: 
$$x^{t+1} = f_{HR}(x^t, u_R, u_H)$$  {#eq-eq3.35}
At a given time step $t$, we
have $x_t$, $u_R^t$, and $u_H^t$. This can be encapsulated into a single
$d$ dimensional feature vector that the authors denote as $\phi$. The
paper then assumes that the underlying reward model we are trying to
learn can be represented linearly. If we have our human reward
preference function defined as $r_H$, this means we can write $r_H$ as:
$$r_H(x^t, u_R^t, u_H^t) = w^{\intercal}\phi(x^t, u_R^t, u_H^t)$$ {#eq-eq3.35}
Because the reward function is linear, we can take the weight vector out
of the summation if we want to calculate the reward over an entire
trajectory:
$$\begin{aligned}
R_{H}(x^0, u_R, u_H) &= \sum_{t=0}^{N} r_{H}(x^t, u^t, u_H^t)\\
\Phi &= \sum \phi(x^t, u_R^t, u_H^t)\\ 
R_H(traj) &= w\cdot\Phi(traj)\end{aligned}$$ {#eq-eq3.36}

#### Properties of $W$ {.unnumbered}

First, the scale of $w$ does not matter because we only care about the
relative rewards produced with $w$ (given two different trajectories, we
want to answer the question of which trajectory a human would prefer,
i.e. which one has a higher preference reward). This means we can
constrain $||w|| <= 1$, so the initial prior is uniform over a unit
ball. From here, we can determine a probabilistic expression to assess
whether we should prefer trajectory A or B (because it can be noisy with
human input). Let $I_t = +1$ if the human prefers trajectory $A$ and let
$I_t = -1$ if the human prefers trajectory $B$. We get the following for
$p(I_t | w)$.

$$\begin{aligned}
p(I_t = +1|w) &= \frac{exp(R_H(traj_A))}{exp(R_H(traj_A)) + exp(R_H(traj_B))}\\
p(I_t = -1|w) &= \frac{exp(R_H(traj_B))}{exp(R_H(traj_A)) + exp(R_H(traj_B))}
\end{aligned}$$ {#eq-eq3.37}

We can re-write this expression to make it cleaner, using the following
substitution: $$\psi = \Phi(traj_a) - \Phi(traj_b)$$ {#eq-eq3.38}
$$f_{\psi} (w) = p(I_t|w) = \frac{1}{1 + exp(-I_tw^{\intercal}\psi)}$$ {#eq-eq3.39}

The idea now is that we can update $p(w)$ everytime we get a result from
a human preference query using Bayes:

$$p(w|I_t) <- p(w) \cdot p(I_t|w)$$ {#eq-eq3.40}

We do not need to know $p(I_t)$ because we can use an algorithm like the
Metropolis algorithm to actually sample.

#### Generating Queries {.unnumbered}

This is where the interesting part of the paper comes into play. How do
we actually generate queries for the user to pick between? This paper
synthetically generates queries through an optimization process and then
presents them to a human to pick between. The idea is that we want to
generate a query that maximizes the conditional entropy $H(I|w)$. There
are a few ways to think about this -- intuitively we want to pick a
query that we are most uncertain about given our current weights (thus
having the highest conditional entropy given the weights). The way the
authors of the paper frame this originally in the paper is that \"we
want to find the next query such that it will help us remove as much
volume (the integral of the unnormalized pdf over w) as possible from
the space of possible rewards.\" Mathematically this can be written as:

$$max_{x^0, u_R, u_H^A, u_H^B} min\{E[1-f_{\psi}(w)], E[1 - f_{-\psi}(w)]\}$$ {#eq-eq3.41}

But how exactly do we optimize this expression mathematically? After
all, we need to use this expression to generate synthetic queries. The
answer is to sample $w_1, ... w_m$ from $p(w)$. We can assume we are
sampling points from a point cloud, thus approximating the distribution
$p(w)$ as

$$p(w) = \frac{1}{M} \sum \delta (w_i).$$  {#eq-eq3.42}
We can now approximate the expectation expression like so:
$$E[1 - f_{\psi}(w)] = \frac{1}{M} (\sum 1 - f_{\psi}(w_i))$$ {#eq-eq3.43}

and now we can optimize the expression to generate a synthetic query!
Altogether, the algorithm looks like the following:

```pseudocode
#| label: alg-design
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Preference-Based Learning of Reward Functions}
\begin{algorithmic}
    \State \textbf{input:} features $\phi$, horizon $N$, dynamics $f$, $iter$
    \State \textbf{initialize:} $p(w) \sim Uniform(B)$, for a unit ball $B$
    \While{$t < iter$}
        \State $W \gets M$ samples from $AdaptiveMetropolis(p(w))$
        \State $(x^0, u_R, u^A_H, u^B_H) \gets SynthExps(W,f)$
        \State $I_t \gets QueryHuman(x^0, u_R, u^A_H, u^B_H)$
        \State $\varphi = \Phi(x^0, u_R, u^A_H) - \Phi(x^0, u_R, u^B_H)$
        \State $f_\varphi(w) = \min(1, I_t\exp(w^\top \varphi))$
        \State $p(w) \gets p(w) \cdot f_\varphi(w)$
        \State $t \gets t+1$
    \EndWhile
    \State \textbf{output:} distribution of $w: p(w)$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

#### Batching Queries {.unnumbered}

The algorithm itself works well, however there ends up being a bottle
neck that each query needs to be synthesized before being sent to the
human -- one at a time. In other words, the human gives their feedback,
waits for a query to be synthesized, and then gives another data point
of feedback. There is no room for parallelization and so the authors
proposed a second algorithm in a separate paper that allows for the
batching of queries. Simply put, we change the mathematical expression
to the following:

$$max_{\xi_{ib+1_A}, \xi_{ib+1_B}, ... , \xi_{ib+b_A}, \xi_{ib+b_B} H(I_{ib+1}, I_{ib+2}, .., I_{ib+b} | w)}$$ {#eq-eq3.44}

Naively, we could consider optimizing this in the greedy fashion. This
would mean just synthetically generating $b$ independent queries. The
obvious drawback of this method would be that the queries would likely
be very similar to each other. The authors propose a few other
heuristics that would help guide the algorithm away from generating very
similar queries. As an example, the authors propose Medioid Selection
where we have to cluster $B$ greedy vectors into $b < B$ groups and pick
one vector from each group (the medioid). The authors also propose two
other methods rooted in providing different queries: boundary medioids
selection and successive elimination. They are best visually depicted
as:

![Different selection strategies](Figures/greedy.png){#fig-selection-strategy width="75%"}

#### Results {.unnumbered}

The authors test both the non-batched and variety of batched learning
algorithms on multiple environments:

![Comparison between batched and non-batched algorithms](Figures/activeresults.png){#fig-batch-nonbatch width="75%"}

What is interesting to note is that when graphed over $N$ the
non-batched active learning approach does in the same ball-park of
performance as the batched approaches. However, if you graph it over
time, we see that learning is a much slower process when not-batched.

### Application: Foundation Models for Robotics

Modern foundation models have been ubiquitous in discussions of
powerful, general purpose AI systems that can accomplish myriad tasks
across many disciplines such as programming, medicine, law, open
question-answering and much more, with rapidly increasing capabilities
[@bommasani2022opportunities]. However, despite successes from large
labs in controlled environments [@brohan2023rt2] foundation models have
not seen ubiquitous use in robotics due to shifting robot morphology,
lack of data, and the sim to real gap in robotics
[@walke2023bridgedata]. For this subsection we explore two promising
approaches known as R3M and Voltron which are the first to leverage
pre-training on vast amounts of data towards performance improvement on
downstream robotic tasks despite the aforementioned issues
[@nair2022r3m; @karamcheti2023languagedriven].

#### R3M: Universal Visual Representation for Robotics {.unnumbered}

![R3M pipeline](Figures/r3m.png){#fig-r3m-pipline width="95%"}

R3M represents a significant advancement in the field of robotic
manipulation and learning. This model diverges from traditional
approaches that rely on training from scratch within the same domain on
the same robot data as instead it leverags pretraining on large
datasets, akin to the practices in computer vision and natural language
processing (NLP) where models are trained on diverse, large-scale
datasets to create reusable, general-purpose representations.

The core principle behind R3M is its training methodology. It is
pre-trained on a wide array of human videos, encompassing various
activities and interactions. This diverse dataset enables the model to
capture a broad spectrum of physical interactions and dynamics, which
are crucial for effective robotic manipulation known as EGO4D
[@grauman2022ego4d]. However, prior papers could not fit this dataset
well, and R3M leveraged. The training utilizes a unique objective that
combines time contrastive learning, video-language alignment, and a
sparsity penalty. This objective ensures that R3M not only understands
the temporal dynamics of scenes (i.e., how states transition over time)
but also focuses on semantically relevant features, such as objects and
their interrelations, while maintaining a compact and efficient
representation.

What sets R3M apart in the realm of robotics is its efficiency and
effectiveness in learning from a limited amount of data. The model
demonstrates remarkable performance in learning tasks in the real world
with minimal human supervision -- typically less than 10 minutes. This
is a stark contrast to traditional models that require extensive and
often prohibitively large datasets for training. Furthermore, R3M's
pre-trained nature allows for its application across a variety of tasks
and environments without the need for retraining from scratch, making it
a versatile tool in robotic manipulation. The empirical results from
using R3M are compelling, leading to a 10% improvement over training
from a pretrained image-net model, self-supervised approaches such as
MoCo or even CLIP
[@deng2009imagenet; @he2020momentum; @radford2021learning]. Note
however, that R3m does **not** use any language data which leaves quite
a bit of supervision to be desired.

#### Voltron: Language Driven Representation Learning for Robotics {.unnumbered}

Building off the success of R3M, Voltron proposes a further extension of
leveraging self-supervision and advancements in foundation models, and
multi-modality. Voltron takes on an intuitive and simple dual use
objective, where the trained model alternates between predicting the
task in an image through natural language and classifying images based
on a natural text label. This forces a nuanced understanding of both
modalities [@radford2021learning].

Voltron's approach is distinguished by its versatility and depth of
learning. It is adept at handling a wide range of robotic tasks, from
low-level spatial feature recognition to high-level semantic
understanding required in language-conditioned imitation and intent
scoring. This flexibility makes it suitable for various applications in
robotic manipulation, from grasping objects based on descriptive
language to performing complex sequences of actions in response to
verbal instructions.

![Voltron pipeline](Figures/voltron.png){#fig-voltron-pipeline width="95%"}

The authors rigorously test Voltron in scenarios such as dense
segmentation for grasp affordance prediction, object detection in
cluttered scenes, and learning multi-task language-conditioned policies
for real-world manipulation with up to 15% improvement over baselines.
In each of these domains, Voltron has shown a remarkable ability to
outperform existing models like MVP and R3M, showcasing its superior
adaptability and learning capabilities [@xiao2022masked].

Moreover, Voltron's framework allows for a balance between encoding
low-level and high-level features, which is critical in the context of
robotics. This balance enables the model to excel in both control tasks
and those requiring deeper semantic understanding, offering a
comprehensive solution in the realm of robotic vision and manipulation.

Voltron stands as a groundbreaking approach in the field of robotics,
offering a language-driven, versatile, and efficient approach to
learning and manipulation. Its ability to seamlessly integrate visual
and linguistic data makes it a potent tool in the ever-evolving
landscape of robotic technology, with potential applications that extend
far beyond current capabilities. Interesting the authors show Voltron
does not beat R3M off the shelf but only when trained on similar amounts
of data. Nevertheless, Voltron's success in diverse tasks and
environments heralds a new era in robotic manipulation, where language
and vision coalesce to create more intelligent, adaptable, and capable
robotic systems.

### Conclusion

On the note of applying active learning to RL and environment settings,
there have been many recent papers that have attempted to extend this to
more modern RL environments. For example, the paper \"When to Ask for
Help\" [@ask_help] examines the intersection of autonomous and active
learning. Instead of just expecting an RL agent to autonomously solve a
task, making the assumption that an agent could get stuck and need human
input to get \"unstuck\" is a key insight of the paper. In general,
there has been an emphasis in recent literature in robotics on not just
blindly using demonstration data as a form of human input, but rather
actively querying a human and using this to better synthesize correct
actions.

Active learning holds promise for enhancing AI models in real-world
scenarios, yet several challenges persist. This discussion aims to
provide an overview of these challenges.

**Task-Specific Considerations:**

For certain tasks, the input space of a model may have some rare yet
extremely important pockets which may never be discovered by active
learning and may cause severe blindspots in the model. In medical
imaging for instance, there can be rare yet critical diseases. Designing
AL strategies for medical image analysis must prioritize rare classes,
such as various forms of cancers. Oftentimes, collecting data around
those rare classes is not a recommendation of the active learning
process because these examples constitute heavy distribution drifts from
the input distribution a model has seen.

**Complex Task Adaptation:**

AL has predominantly been adopted for simple classification tasks,
leaving more other types of tasks (generative ones for instance), less
explored. In Natural Language Processing, tasks like natural language
inference, question-answering pose additional complexities that affect
the direct application of the active learning process. While machine
translation has seen AL applications, generation tasks in NLP require
more thorough exploration. Challenges arise in obtaining unlabeled data,
particularly for tasks with intricate inputs.

**Unsupervised and Semi-Supervised Approaches:**

In the presence of large datasets without sufficient labels,
unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches become crucial. These
methods offer a means to extract information without relying on labeled
data for every data point, potentially revolutionizing fields like
medical image analysis. There is an ongoing need for methods that
combine self/semi-supervised learning with active learning.

**Algorithm Scalability:**

Scalability is a critical concern for online AL algorithms, particularly
when dealing with large datasets and high-velocity data streams. The
computational demands of AL can become prohibitive as data volume
increases, posing challenges for practical deployment. Issues of
catastrophic forgetting and model plasticity further complicate
scalability, requiring careful consideration in algorithm design.

**Labeling Quality Assurance:**

The effectiveness of most online AL strategies hinges on the quality of
labeled data. Ensuring labeling accuracy in real-world scenarios is
challenging, with human annotators prone to errors, biases, and diverse
interpretations. Addressing imperfections in labeling through
considerations of oracle imperfections becomes essential in real-life AL
applications. Solutions for cleaning up data and verifying its quality
need to be more aggressively pursued.

**Data Drift Challenges:**

Real-world settings introduce data drift, where distributions shift over
time, challenging models to adapt for accurate predictions. These shifts
can impact the quality of labeled data acquired in the AL process. For
example, the criterion or proxy used for selecting informative instances
may be thrown off when the distribution a model is trained on, and the
distribution we want it to perform well on, are too far away from one
another.

**Evaluation in Real-Life Scenarios**:

While AL methods are often evaluated assuming access to ground-truth
labels, the real motivation for AL lies in label scarcity. Assessing the
effectiveness of AL strategies becomes challenging in real-life
scenarios where ground-truth labels may be limited. In other words, one
may verify the goodness of an AL algorithm within the lab, but once the
algorithm is deployed for improving all sorts of models on all sorts of
data distributions, verifying whether AL is actually improving a model
is tricky, especially when collecting and labeling data from the target
distribution is expensive and defeats the purpose of using AL in the
first place.

By systematically addressing these challenges, the field of active
learning in AI can progress towards more effective and practical
applications.

In summary, active learning is a promising modern tool to model training
that presents potential benefits. As was mentioned at the start, there
are numerous approaches that can be employed by active learning,
starting from reducing error of model's prediction, reducing variance,
to more conformal predictions. The flavor of active learning heavily
depends on the applications, which include robotics, LLM, autonomous
vehicles, and more. We discussed in more detail how to perform active
learning for variance reduction in the case of predicting kinematics of
the robotic arms, which showed decrease in MSE as well as more stable
reduction in it. Next we talked about using active learning for reducing
the number of comparisons required to create a ranking of objects, and
the examples discussed were able to achieve that but with some loss in
the prediction accuracy. Finally, we discussed how active learning can
be used for modeling of reward functions within a dynamical system,
which demonstrated improvements in performance and time required to
achieve it. For a more hands-on experience with active learning and
demonstrated example, we encourage the readers to explore a blogpost by
Max Halford [@max_halford].


## Metric Elicitation {#sec-metric-elicitation}

### Introduction to Performance Metric Elicitation

In binary classification problems, selecting an appropriate performance metric that aligns with the real-world 
task is crucial. The problem of *metric elicitation* aims to characterize and discover the performance metric of a 
practitioner, reflecting the rewards or costs associated with correct or incorrect classification. For instance, 
in medical contexts such as diagnosing a disease or determining the appropriateness of a treatment, trade-offs are 
made for incorrect decisions. Not administering a treatment could lead to the worsening of a disease (a false negative), 
whereas delivering the wrong treatment could cause adverse side effects worse than not treating the condition (a false positive).

Rather than choosing from a limited set of default choices like the F1-score or weighted accuracy, metric elicitation 
considers the process of devising a metric that best matches the preferences of practitioners or users. This is 
achieved by querying an "oracle" who provides feedback on proposed potential metrics through pairwise comparisons. 
Since queries to humans are often expensive, the goal is to minimize the number of comparisons needed.

**Note:** Contents in this section are derived from "Performance Metric Elicitation from Pairwise 
Classifier Comparisons" by [@pmlr-v89-hiranandani19a], which introduced the problem of metric 
elicitation and the framework for binary-class metric elicitation from pairwise comparisons. This section aims to 
present their work expository while providing additional motivation and intuitive explanations to supplement their work.

The motivation for the pairwise comparison aspect of metric elicitation stems from a rich history of literature in 
psychology, economics, and computer science [@pref1; @pref2; @pref3; @pref4; @ab], demonstrating that humans are often 
ineffective at providing absolute feedback on aspects such as potential prices, user interfaces, or even ML model 
outputs (hence the comparison-based structure of RLHF, for instance). Additionally, confusion matrices accurately 
capture binary metrics such as accuracy, $F_\beta$, and Jaccard similarity by recording the number of false positives, 
true positives, false negatives, and true negatives obtained by a classifier. The main goal of this chapter is to 
introduce two binary-search procedures that can approximate the oracle's performance metric for two types of metrics 
(linear and linear-fractional performance metrics) by presenting the oracle with confusion matrices generated by 
various classifiers. Essentially, we are learning an optimal threshold for classification given a decision boundary 
for a binary classification problem.

First, we introduce some relevant notation that will later be used to formalize notions of oracle queries, 
classifiers, and metrics. In this context, $X \in \mathcal{X}$ represents an input random variable, while 
$Y \in \{0, 1\}$ denotes the output random variable. We learn from a dataset of size $n$, denoted by 
$\{(x, y)_i\}^n_{i=1}$, which is generated independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) from some 
distribution $\mathbb{P}(X, Y)$. The conditional probability of the positive class, given some sample $x$, 
is denoted by $\eta(\vec{x}) = \mathbb{P}(Y=1 | X=x)$. The marginal probability of the positive class 
is represented by $\zeta = \mathbb{P}(Y=1)$. 

The set of all potential classifiers is $\mathcal{H} = \{h : \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \{0,1\}\}$. The confusion 
matrix for a classifier $h$ is $C(h, \mathbb{P}) \in \mathbb{R}^{2 \times 2}$, where $C_{ij}(h, \mathbb{P}) = \mathbb{P}(Y=i, h=j)$ 
for $i, j \in \{0,1\}$. These entries represent the false positives, true positives, false negatives, and true negatives, 
ensuring that $\sum_{i,j}C_{ij}=1$. The set of all confusion matrices is denoted by $\mathcal{C}$. Since 
$FN(h, \mathbb{P}) = \zeta - TP(h, \mathbb{P})$ and $FP(h, \mathbb{P}) = 1 - \zeta - TN(h, \mathbb{P})$, $\mathcal{C}$ 
is actually a 2-dimensional space, not a 4-dimensional space.

Any hyperplane in the $(tp, tn)$ space is given by $\ell := a \cdot tp + b \cdot tn = c$, where $a, b, c \in \mathbb{R}$. 
Given a classifier $h$, we define a performance metric $\phi : [0, 1]^{2 \times 2} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. The value 
$\phi(C(h))$, which represents the performance of a classifier with respect to a certain metric, is referred to as the 
*utility* of the classifier $h$. We assume, without loss of generality, that a higher value of $\phi$ indicates a better 
performance metric for $h$. Our focus is to recover some metric $\phi$ using comparisons between confusion matrices $C(h)$, 
determined by classifiers $h$, which approximates the oracle's "ground-truth" metric $\phi^*$.

Next, we introduce two classes of performance metrics—*Linear Performance Metrics (LPM)* and *Linear-Fractional 
Performance Metrics (LFPM)*—for which we will present two elicitation algorithms. 

An *LPM*, given constants $\{a_{11}, a_{01}, a_{10}, a_{00}\} \in \mathbb{R}^{4}$, is defined as:

$$\begin{aligned}
\phi(C) &= a_{11} TP + a_{01} FP + a_{10} FN + a_{00} TN\\
&= m_{11} TP + m_{00} TN + m_{0},
\end{aligned}$$ {#eq-eqlpm}

where $m_{11} = (a_{11} - a_{10})$, $m_{00} = (a_{00} - a_{01})$, and $m_{0} = a_{10} \zeta + a_{01} (1 - \zeta)$. 
This reparametrization simplifies the metric by reducing dimensionality, making it more tractable for elicitation. 
One example of an LPM is *weighted accuracy*, defined as $WA = w_1TP + w_2TN$, where adjusting $w_1$ and $w_2$ controls 
the relative importance of different types of misclassification.

An *LFPM*, defined by constants $\{a_{11}, a_{01}, a_{10}, a_{00}, b_{11}, b_{01}, b_{10}, b_{00}\} \in \mathbb{R}^{8}$, is given by:

$$\begin{aligned}
\phi(C) &= \frac{a_{11} TP + a_{01} FP + a_{10} FN + a_{00} TN}{b_{11} TP + b_{01} FP + b_{10} FN + b_{00} TN}\\
&= \frac{p_{11} TP + p_{00} TN + p_{0}}{q_{11} TP + q_{00} TN + q_{0}},
\end{aligned}$$ {#eq-eqlfpm}

where $p_{11} = (a_{11} - a_{10})$, $p_{00} = (a_{00} - a_{01})$, $q_{11} = (b_{11} - b_{10})$, $q_{00} = (b_{00} - b_{01})$, 
$p_{0} = a_{10} \zeta + a_{01} (1 - \zeta)$, and $q_{0} = b_{10} \zeta + b_{01} (1 - \zeta)$. This parametrization also 
simplifies the elicitation process by reducing the number of variables. Common LFPMs include the $F_\beta$ score and Jaccard 
similarity, defined as:

$$F_{\beta} = \frac{TP}{\frac{TP}{1+\beta^{2}} - \frac{TN}{1+\beta^{2}} + \frac{\beta^{2} \zeta + 1 - \zeta}{1+\beta^{2}}}, \quad JAC = \frac{TP}{1 - TN}.$$ {#eq-lfpm_metrics}

Setting $\beta = 1$ gives the F1 score, which is widely used as a classification metric in machine learning.

### Preliminaries {#sec-me-preliminaries}
#### Confusion Matrices {#sec-confusion-matrices .unnumbered}

Since we are considering all possible metrics in the LPM and LFPM families, we need to make certain assumptions 
about $\mathcal{C}$. Particularly, we will assume that $g(t) = \mathbb{P}[\eta(X) \geq t]$ is continuous and 
strictly decreasing for $t \in [0, 1]$; essentially, $\eta$ has positive density and zero probability.

Additionally, $\mathcal{C}$ is convex, closed, and contained within the rectangle $[0, \zeta] \times [0, 1-\zeta]$, 
and is rotationally symmetric around its center, $(\frac{\zeta}{2}, \frac{1-\zeta}{2})$, where the axes represent the 
proportion of true positives and negatives. The only vertices of $\mathcal{C}$ are $(0, 1-\zeta)$ and $(\zeta, 0)$, 
corresponding to predicting all $0$'s or all $1$'s on a given dataset. Therefore, $\mathcal{C}$ is strictly convex, 
and any line tangent to it is tangent at exactly one point, corresponding to one particular confusion matrix; these 
properties can be visually observed in @fig-c.

![Visual representation of $\mathcal{C}$](Figures/Screenshot 2023-11-13 at 6.56.44 PM.png){#fig-c width="50%"}

Next, recall that an LPM is represented in terms of three parameters ($\phi = m_{11}TP + m_{00}TN + m_0$). We have 
just seen that this LPM and its corresponding confusion matrix correspond to a certain point on the boundary of 
$\mathcal{C}$. We first note that this point is independent of $m_0$. Additionally, we only care about the relative 
weightings of $m_{11}$ and $m_{00}$, not their actual values—they are scale invariant. Therefore, we can parametrize 
the space of LPMs as $\varphi_{LPM} = \{\mathbf{m} = (\cos \theta, \sin \theta) : \theta \in [0, 2\pi]\}$, where 
$\cos \theta$ corresponds to $m_{00}$ and $\sin \theta$ corresponds to $m_{11}$. As we already know, we can recover 
the Bayes classifier given $\mathbf{m}$, and it is unique, corresponding to one point on the boundary of $\mathcal{C}$ 
due to its convexity. The supporting hyperplane at this point is defined as

$$\bar{\ell}_{\mathbf{m}} := m_{11} \cdot tp + m_{00} \cdot tn = m_{11} \overline{TP}_{\mathbf{m}} + m_{00} \overline{TN}_{\mathbf{m}}$$  {#eq-eq3.47}

We note that if $m_{00}$ and $m_{11}$ have opposite signs, then $\bar{h}_m$ is the trivial classifier predicting 
all 1's or all 0's, since either predicting true positives or true negatives results in negative reward. This corresponds 
to a supporting hyperplane with a positive slope, so it can only be tangent at the vertices.

Additionally, the boundary $\partial \mathcal{C}$ can be split into upper and lower boundaries 
($\partial \mathcal{C}_{+}, \partial \mathcal{C}_{-}$), corresponding to $\theta \in (0, \pi/2)$ and $\theta \in (\pi, 3\pi/2)$ 
respectively (and whether $m_{00}, m_{11}$ are positive or negative).

#### Bayes Optimal and Inverse-Optimal Classifiers {.unnumbered}

We also define the notions of Bayes optimal and inverse-optimal classifiers. Given a performance metric $\phi$, we define:

-   The *Bayes utility* as $\bar{\tau} := \sup_{h \in \mathcal{H}} \phi(C(h)) = \sup_{C \in \mathcal{C}} \phi(C)$; 
    this is the highest achievable utility (using the metric $\phi$) over all classifiers $h \in $\mathcal{H}$ for a given problem.
-   The *Bayes classifier* as $\bar{h} := \arg \max_{h \in \mathcal{H}} \phi(C(h))$; this is the classifier $h$ corresponding to the Bayes utility.
-   The *Bayes confusion matrix* as $\bar{C} := \arg \max_{C \in \mathcal{C}} \phi(C)$; this is the confusion matrix 
    corresponding to the Bayes utility and classifier.

Similarly, the inverse Bayes utility, classifier, and confusion matrix can be defined by replacing "$\sup$" with "$\inf$"; 
they represent the classifier and confusion matrix corresponding to the lower bound on utility for a given problem.

We also have the following useful proposition:

::: {.callout-note title="proposition"}
::: {#prp-prp3.1}
Let $\phi \in \varphi_{LPM}$. Then

::: {.content-visible when-format="html"}
$$\bar{h}(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{lr}
\unicode{x1D7D9} \left[\eta(x) \geq \frac{m_{00}}{m_{11} + m_{00}}\right], & m_{11} + m_{00} \geq 0 \\
\unicode{x1D7D9} \left[\frac{m_{00}}{m_{11} + m_{00}} \geq \eta(x)\right], & \text { o.w. }
\end{array}\right\}$$  {#eq-eq3.45}
:::

::: {.content-visible when-format="pdf"}
$$\bar{h}(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{lr}
\mathbbm{1}\left[\eta(x) \geq \frac{m_{00}}{m_{11} + m_{00}}\right], & m_{11} + m_{00} \geq 0 \\
\mathbbm{1}\left[\frac{m_{00}}{m_{11} + m_{00}} \geq \eta(x)\right], & \text { o.w. }
\end{array}\right\}$$  {#eq-eq3.46}
:::

is a Bayes optimal classifier with respect to $\phi$. The inverse Bayes classifier is given by $\underline{h} = 1 - \bar{h}$.
:::
:::

This is a simple derivation based on the fact that we only get rewards from true positives and true negatives. 
Essentially, if we recover an LPM, we can use it to determine the best-performing classifier, obtained by placing 
a threshold on the conditional probability of a given sample, that corresponds to a confusion matrix. Therefore, 
the three notions of Bayes utility, classifier, and confusion matrix are functionally equivalent in our setting.


### Problem Setup {#sec-metric-elicitation-setup}

We will now formalize the problem of metric elicitation. Given two classifiers $h$ and $h'$ (or equivalently, 
two confusion matrices $C$ and $C'$), we define an *oracle query* as the function:

::: {.content-visible when-format="html"}
$$\Gamma\left(h, h^{\prime}\right)=\Omega\left(C, C^{\prime}\right)=\unicode{x1D7D9}\left[\phi(C)>\phi\left(C^{\prime}\right)\right]=: \unicode{x1D7D9} \left[C \succ C^{\prime}\right],$$ {#eq-oracle}
:::

::: {.content-visible when-format="pdf"}
$$\Gamma\left(h, h^{\prime}\right)=\Omega\left(C, C^{\prime}\right)=\mathbbm{1}\left[\phi(C)>\phi\left(C^{\prime}\right)\right]=: \mathbbm{1} \left[C \succ C^{\prime}\right],$$ {#eq-oracle}
:::

which represents the classifier preferred by the practitioner. We can then define the metric elicitation problem for populations:

::: {.callout-note title="definition"}
::: {#def-def3.1}
Suppose the true (oracle) performance metric is $\phi$. The goal is to recover a metric $\hat{\phi}$ by 
querying the oracle for as few pairwise comparisons of the form $\Omega\left(C, C^{\prime}\right)$ so that 
$\|\phi - \hat{\phi}\|_{--} < \kappa$ for a sufficiently small $\kappa > 0$ and for any suitable norm $\|\cdot\|_{--}$.
:::
:::

In practice, we do not have access to the true probability distribution or the population, which would 
provide the true values of $C$ and $C'$. However, we can subtly alter this problem description to use 
$\hat{C}$ and $\hat{C}^{\prime}$, which are derived from our dataset of $n$ samples:

::: {.callout-note title="definition"}
::: {#def-def3.2}
Suppose the true (oracle) performance metric is $\phi$. The aim is to recover a metric $\hat{\phi}$ 
by querying the oracle for as few pairwise comparisons of the form $\Omega\left(\hat{C}, \hat{C}^{\prime}\right)$ 
so that $\|\phi - \hat{\phi}\|_{--} < \kappa$ for a sufficiently small $\kappa > 0$ and for any suitable norm $\|\cdot\|_{--}$.
:::
:::

As is common in theoretical ML research, we solve the population problem and then consider ways to extend this to 
practical settings where we only have limited datasets of samples. In our case, this corresponds to calculating the 
confusion matrices from a portion of the dataset we have access to.


### Linear Performance Metric Elicitation {#sec-orgb6dac4e}

For LPM elicitation, we need one more proposition.

::: {.callout-note title="proposition"}
::: {#prp-prp3.2}
For a metric $\psi$ (quasiconvex and monotone increasing in TP/TN) or
$\phi$ (quasiconcave and monotone increasing), and parametrization
$\rho^+$/$\rho^-$ of upper/lower boundary, composition
$\psi \circ \rho^-$ is quasiconvex and unimodal on \[0, 1\], and
$\phi \circ \rho^+$ is quasiconcave and unimodal on \[0, 1\].
:::
:::

Quasiconcavity and quasiconvexity are slightly more general variations
on concavity and convexity. Their main useful property in our setting is
that they are unimodal (they have a singular extremum), so we can devise
a binary-search-style algorithm for eliciting the Bayes optimal and
inverse-optimal confusion matrices for a given setting, as well as the
corresponding $\phi$'s.

We first note that to maximize a quasiconcave metric, in which $\phi$ is
monotonically increasing in $TP$ and $TN$, we note that the resulting
maximizer (and supporting hyperplane) will occur on the upper boundary
of $\mathcal{C}$. We thus set our initial search range to be
$[0, \pi/2]$ and repeatedly divide it into four regions. Then, we
calculate the resulting confusion matrix on the 5 resulting boundaries of these
regions and query the oracle $4$ times. We repeat this in each iteration
of the binary search until a maximizer is found.

::: {.callout-note title="remark"}
::: {#rem-explaination_binary_search}
In the case of quasiconcave and quasiconvex search ranges, a slightly more sophisticated variation on typical 
binary search must be used. To illustrate this, consider the two distributions in @fig-bsearch:

::: {#fig-bsearch layout-ncol=2}
![First distribution](Figures/normaldistribution.png){#fig-normal-distribution width="100%"}

![Second distribution](Figures/normaldistribution copy.png){#fig-normal-distribution-copy width="94%"}
:::

For both the symmetric and skewed distributions, if we were to divide the search range into two portions 
and compare $A$, $C$, and $E$, we would find that $C > A$ and $C > E$. In both cases, this does not help 
us reduce our search range, since the true maximum could lie on either of the two intervals (as in the second case), 
or at $C$ itself (as in the first case). Therefore, we must make comparisons between all five points $A, B, C, D, and E$. 
This allows us to correctly restrict our search range to $[B, D]$ in the first case and $[C, E]$ in the second. 
These extra search requirements are due to the quasiconcavity of the search space we are considering, in which 
there exists a maximum but we need to make several comparisons at various points throughout the search space 
to be able to reduce its size in each iteration.

be the slope of the resulting hyperplane, since the metric is linear.

### Linear-Fractional Performance Metric Elicitation {#sec-lfpm-elicitation}

Now, we present the next main result, which is an algorithm to elicit
linear-fractional performance metrics. For this task, we will need the
following assumption:

Let $\phi \in \varphi_{L F P M}$. We assume
$p_{11}, p_{00} \geq 0, p_{11} \geq q_{11}, p_{00} \geq q_{00},$
$p_{0}=0, q_{0}=$
$\left(p_{11}-q_{11}\right) \zeta+\left(p_{00}-q_{00}\right)(1-\zeta)$,
and $p_{11}+p_{00}=1$.

These assumptions guarantee that the LFPM $\phi$ which we are trying to
elicit is monotonically increasing in $TP$ and $TN$, just as in the LPM
elicitation case.

We first provide motivation and an overview of the approach for LFPM
elicitation and then present pseudocode for the algorithm.

The general idea of the algorithm is to use @alg-lpm to obtain a
maximizer and a minimizer for the given dataset; these result in two
systems of equations involving the true LFPM $\phi^*$ with 1 degree of
freedom. Then, we run a grid search that is independent of oracle
queries to find the point where solutions to the systems match pointwise
on the resulting confusion matrices; this occurs close to where the true
metric lies.

More formally, suppose that the true metric is
$$\phi^{*}(C)=\frac{p_{11}^{*} T P+p_{00}^{*} T N}{q_{11}^{*} T P+q_{00}^{*} T N+q_{0}^{*}}.$$  {#eq-eq3.48}
Then, let $\bar{\tau}$ and $\underline{\tau}$ represent the maximizer
and minimizer of $\phi$ over $\mathcal{C}$, respectively. There exists a
hyperplane 
$$\begin{aligned}
\bar{\ell}_{f}^{*}:=\left(p_{11}^{*}-\bar{\tau}^{*} q_{11}^{*}\right) t p+\left(p_{00}^{*}-\bar{\tau}^{*} q_{00}^{*}\right) t n=\bar{\tau}^{*} q_{0}^{*},
\end{aligned}$$   {#eq-eq3.49}
which touches $\mathcal{C}$ at $\left(\overline{T P}^{*}, \overline{T N}^{*}\right)$ on
$\partial \mathcal{C}_{+}$.

Correspondingly, there also exists a hyperplane 
$$\begin{aligned}
\underline{\ell}_{f}^{*}:=\left(p_{11}^{*}-\underline{\tau}^{*} q_{11}^{*}\right) t p+\left(p_{00}^{*}-\underline{\tau}^{*} q_{00}^{*}\right) \operatorname{tn}=\underline{\tau}^{*} q_{0}^{*},
\end{aligned}$$   {#eq-eq3.50}
which touches $\mathcal{C}$ at $\left(\underline{TP}^{*}, \underline{T N}^{*}\right)$ on
$\partial \mathcal{C}_{-}$. @fig-minmax illustrates this visually on $\mathcal{C}$.

![Visual representation of the minimizer and maximizer on
$\mathcal{C}$](Figures/Screenshot 2023-11-13 at 6.56.52 PM.png){#fig-minmax
width="50%"}

While we are unable to obtain @eq-eq3.48 and @eq-eq3.49 directly, we can use @alg-lpm to get a hyperplane
$$\bar{\ell}:=\bar{m}_{11} t p+\bar{m}_{00} t n= \bar{m}_{11} \overline{T P}^{*}+\bar{m}_{00} \overline{T N}^{*} = \bar{C}_{0},$$  {#eq-eq3.51}
which is equivalent to $\bar{\ell}_{f}^{*}$ (@eq-eq3.48) up to a constant
multiple. From here, we can obtain the system of equations

$$p_{11}^{*}-\bar{\tau}^{*} q_{11}^{*}=\alpha \bar{m}_{11}, p_{00}^{*}-\bar{\tau}^{*} q_{00}^{*}=\alpha \bar{m}_{00}, \bar{\tau}^{*} q_{0}^{*}=\alpha \bar{C}_{0},$$  {#eq-eq3.52}
where $\alpha > 0$ (we know it is $\geq0$ due to our assumptions earlier
and because $\bar{m}$ is positive, but if it is equal to $0$ then
$\phi^*$ would be constant. So, our resulting system of equations is
$$\begin{aligned}
    p_{11}^{\prime}-\bar{\tau}^{*} q_{11}^{\prime}=\bar{m}_{11}, p_{00}^{\prime}-\bar{\tau}^{*} q_{00}^{\prime}=\bar{m}_{00}, \bar{\tau}^{*} q_{0}^{\prime}=\bar{C}_{0}.
\end{aligned}$$  {#eq-eq3.53}

Now, similarly, we can approximate @eq-eq3.49 using the algorithm we defined
for quasiconvex metrics (@alg-lfpm), where we altered the search range
and comparisons. After finding the minimizer, we obtain the hyperplane
$$\underline{\ell}:=\underline{m}_{11} t p+\underline{m}_{00} t n=\underline{m}_{11} \underline{TP}^{*}+\underline{m}_{00} \underline{TN}^{*} = \underline{C}_{0},$$  {#eq-eq3.54}
which is equivalent to $\underline{\ell}_{f}^{*}$ (@eq-eq3.49) up to a constant
multiple. So then, our system of equations is
$$p_{11}^{*}-\underline{\tau}^{*} q_{11}^{*}=\gamma \underline{m}_{11}, p_{00}^{*}-\underline{\tau}^{*} q_{00}^{*}=\gamma \underline{m}_{00}, \underline{\tau}^{*} q_{0}^{*}=\gamma \underline{C}_{0},$$  {#eq-eq3.55}
where $\gamma <0$ (for a reason analogous to why we have $\alpha >0$),
meaning our resulting system of equations is 
$$\begin{aligned}
    p_{11}^{\prime \prime}-\underline{\tau}^{*} q_{11}^{\prime \prime}=\underline{m}_{11}, p_{00}^{\prime \prime}-\underline{\tau}^{*} q_{00}^{\prime \prime}=\underline{m}_{00}, \underline{\tau}^{*} q_{0}^{\prime \prime}=\underline{C}_{0}.
\end{aligned}$$  {#eq-eq3.56}

@eq-eq3.55 and @eq-eq3.56 form the two systems of equations mentioned in our overview
of the algorithm. Next, we demonstrate that they have only one degree of
freedom. Note that if we know $p_{11}'$, we could solve both systems of
equations as follows: 
$$\begin{aligned}
    p_{00}^{\prime}  &=1-p_{11}^{\prime}, q_{0}^{\prime}=\bar{C}_{0} \frac{P^{\prime}}{Q^{\prime}}\\
    q_{11}^{\prime}  &=\left(p_{11}^{\prime}-\bar{m}_{11}\right) \frac{P^{\prime}}{Q^{\prime}} \\
    q_{00}^{\prime}&=\left(p_{00}^{\prime}-\bar{m}_{00}\right) \frac{P^{\prime}}{Q^{\prime}},
\end{aligned}$$   {#eq-eq3.57}
where
$P^{\prime}=p_{11}^{\prime} \zeta+p_{00}^{\prime}(1-\zeta)$ and
$Q^{\prime}=P^{\prime}+\bar{C}_{0}-$
$\bar{m}_{11} \zeta-\bar{m}_{00}(1-\zeta).$

Now, suppose we know $p_{11}'$. We could use this value to solve both systems @eq-eq3.55 and @eq-eq3.56, 
yielding two metrics, $\phi'$ and $\phi''$, from the maximizer and minimizer, respectively. Importantly, when
$$p_{11}^{*} / p_{00}^{*}=p_{11}^{\prime} / p_{00}^{\prime}=p_{11}^{\prime \prime} / p_{00}^{\prime \prime},$$ {#eq-eq3.58} 
then
$\phi^{*}(C)=\phi^{\prime}(C) / \alpha=-\phi^{\prime \prime}(C) / \gamma$.
Essentially, when we find a value of $p_{11}'$ that results in $\phi'$ and $\phi''$ h
aving constant ratios at all points on the boundary of $\mathcal{C}$, we can obtain $\phi^*$, 
as it is derivable from $\phi'$ and $\alpha$ (or, alternatively, $\phi''$ and $\gamma$).

We will perform a grid search for $p_{11}'$ on $[0,1]$. For each point in our search, 
we will compute $\phi'$ and $\phi''$. Then, we will generate several confusion matrices 
on the boundaries and calculate the ratio $\phi'' / $\phi'$ for each. We will select the value 
of $p_{11}'$ for which the ratio $\phi'' / \phi'$ is closest to constant and use it to compute 
the elicited metric $\hat{\phi}$. The pseudocode for LFPM elicitation is given in @alg-lfpm.

In summary, to elicit LFPMs, we utilize a special property of the LPM
minimizer and maximizer on $\mathcal{C}$--namely, that we can use the
corresponding supporting hyperplanes to form a system of equations that
can be used to approximate $\phi^*$ if one parameter ($p_{11}'$) is
found, and that this parameter can be found using an oracle-independent
grid search.

#### Guarantees {.unnumbered}

Importantly, these algorithms can be shown to satisfy significant theoretical guarantees. We provide 
 formal statement and intuitive interpretation of these guarantees here, with their proofs available 
 in the appendix of the original paper.

First, we define the oracle noise $\epsilon_{\Omega}$, which arises from the oracle potentially flipping 
the comparison output on two confusion matrices that are close enough in utility.

::: {.callout-note title="theorem"}
::: {#thm-thm1}
Given $\epsilon, \epsilon_{\Omega} \geq 0$ and a metric $\phi$ satisfying our assumptions, @alg-lpm or 
@alg-lfpm finds an approximate maximizer/minimizer and supporting hyperplane. Additionally, the value of 
$\phi$ at that point is within $O\left(\sqrt{\epsilon_{\Omega}} + \epsilon\right)$ of the optimum, and the 
number of queries is $O\left(\log \frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$.
:::
:::

::: {.callout-note title="theorem"}
::: {#thm-thm2}
Let $\mathbf{m}^{*}$ be the true performance metric. Given $\epsilon > 0$, LPM elicitation outputs a performance 
metric $\hat{\mathbf{m}}$, such that $\left\|\mathbf{m}^{*} - \hat{\mathbf{m}}\right\|_{\infty} \leq \sqrt{2} \epsilon + \frac{2}{k_{0}} \sqrt{2 k_{1} \epsilon_{\Omega}}$.
:::
:::

These two theorems ensure that @alg-lpm and @alg-lfpm find an appropriate maximizer and minimizer in the search 
space, within a certain range of accuracy that depends on oracle and sample noise, and within a certain number of 
queries. Both of these statements are guaranteed by the binary search approach.

::: {.callout-note title="theorem"}
::: {#thm-thm3}
Let $h_{\theta}$ and $\hat{h}_{\theta}$ be two classifiers estimated using $\eta$ and $\hat{\eta}$, respectively. 
Further, let $\bar{\theta}$ be such that $h_{\bar{\theta}} = \arg \max _{\theta} \phi\left(h_{\theta}\right)$. 
Then $\|C(\hat{h}_{\bar{\theta}}) - C\left(h_{\bar{\theta}}\right)\|_{\infty} = O\left(\left\|\hat{\eta}_{n} - \eta\right\|_{\infty}\right)$.
:::
:::

This theorem indicates that the drop in elicited metric quality caused by using a dataset of samples rather than 
population confusion matrices is bounded by the drop in performance of the decision boundary $\eta$. These three 
guarantees together ensure that oracle noise and sample noise do not amplify drops in performance when using metric 
elicitation; rather, these drops in performance are bounded by the drops that would typically occur when using the 
standard machine learning paradigm of training a decision boundary and using a pre-established metric.

For further interesting exploration of the types of problems that can be
solved using the framework of metric elicitation, we refer the reader to
[@nips], which performs metric elicitation to determine the oracle's
ideal tradeoff between the classifier's overall performance and the
discrepancy between its performance on certain protected groups.

### Multiclass Performance Metric Elicitation

Although the previous section only described metric elicitation for
binary classification problems, the general framework can still be
applied to multiclass classification problems, as described in
"Multiclass Performance Metric Elicitation" by [@NEURIPS2019_1fd09c5f].

Consider the case of classifying subtypes of
leukemia [@YangNaiman+2014+477+496]. We can train a neural network to
predict conditional probability of a certain leukemia subtype given
certain gene expressions. However, it may not be appropriate to classify
the subtype purely based on whichever one has the highest confidence.
For instance, a treatment for leukemia subtype C1 may be perfect for
cases of C1, but it may be ineffective or harmful for certain other
subtypes. Therefore, the final response from the classifier may not be
as simple as as choosing the class with the highest conditional
probability, just like how the threshold for binary classification may
not always be 50%.

With multiclass metric elicitation, we can show confusion matrices to an
oracle (like the doctor in the leukemia example) to determine which
classifier has the best tradeoffs. In [@NEURIPS2019_1fd09c5f], the
authors focus on eliciting linear performance metrics, which is what we
will describe in this chapter.

#### Preliminaries {.unnumbered}

Most of the notation from Binary Metric Elicitation still persists, just
modified to provide categorical responses:

-   $X \in \mathcal{X}$ is the input random variable.

-   $Y \in [k]$ is the output random variable, where $[k]$ is the index
    set $\{1, 2, \dots, k\}$.

-   The dataset of size $n$ is denoted by $\{(\vec{x}, y)\}_{i=1}^n$
    generated independently and identically from $\mathbb{P}(X, Y)$.

-   $\eta_i(\vec{x}) = \mathbb{P}(Y=i | X=\vec{x})$ gives the
    conditional probability of class $i \in [k]$ given an observation.

-   $\xi_i = \mathbb{P}(Y=i)$ is the marginal probability of class
    $i \in [k]$.

-   The set of all classifiers is
    $\mathcal{H} = \{h : \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \Delta_k\}$, where
    $\Delta_k$ is (k-1) dimensional simplex. In this case, the outputs
    of classifiers are 1-hot vectors of size $k$ where the only index
    with value 1 is the predicted class and all other positions have a
    value of 0.

-   The confusion matrix for a classifier, $h$, is
    $C(h, \mathbb{P}) \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times k}$, where:
    $$C_{ij}(h, \mathbb{P}) = \mathbb{P}(Y=i, h=j) \text{\qquad for } i, j \in [k]$$  {#eq-eq3.59}

Note that the confusion matrices are $k\times k$ and store the joint
probabilities of each type of classification for each possible class.
This means that the sum of row $i$ in the confusion matrix equals
$\xi_i$, because this is equivalent to adding over all possible
classifications. Since we know the sums of each row, all diagonal
elements can be reconstructed from just the off-diagonal elements, so a
confusion matrix $C(h, \mathbb{P})$ can be expressed as a vector of
off-diagonal elements,
$\vec{c}(h, \mathbb{P}) = \textit{off-diag}(C(h, \mathbb{P}))$, and
$\vec{c} \in \mathbb{R}^q$ where $q := k^2 - k$. The vector $\vec{c}$ is
called the vector of *'off-diagonal confusions.'* The space of
off-diagonal confusions is
$\mathcal{C} = \{\vec{c}(h, \mathbb{P}) : h \in \mathcal{H}\}$.

In cases where the oracle would care about the exact type of
misclassification (i.e. misclassifying and object from class 1 as class
2), this off-diagonal confusion matrix is necessary. However, there are
many cases where the performance of a classifier is determined by just
the probability of correct prediction for each class, which just
requires the diagonal elements. In these cases, we can define the vector
of *'diagonal confusions'* as
$\vec{d}(h, \mathbb{P}) = \textit{diag}(C(h, \mathbb{P})) \in \mathbb{R}^k$.
The space of diagonal confusions is
$\mathcal{D} = \{\vec{d}(h, \mathbb{P}) : h \in \mathcal{H}\}$.

Finally, the setup for metric elicitation is identical to the one
examined in the previous chapter. We still assume access to an oracle
that can choose between two classifiers or confusion matrices, using
notation $\Gamma$ for comparing two classifiers and $\Omega$ for
comparing confusion matrices, which returns 1 if the first classifier is
better and 0 otherwise. We still assume that the oracle behaves
according to some unknown performance metric, and we wish to recover
this metric up to some small error tolerance (based on a suitable norm).

The two different types of confusion vectors result in different
algorithms for metric elicitation, which we will explore in later
sections.

#### Introduction to Diagonal Linear Performance Metric Elicitation {.unnumbered}

A Diagonal Linear Performance Metric (DLPM) is a performance metric that
only considers the diagonal elements in the confusion matrix. The metric
is defined as $\psi(\vec{d}) = \langle \vec{a}, \vec{d} \rangle$, where
$\vec{a} \in \mathbb{R}^k$ such that $||\vec{a}||_1 = 1$. It is also
called weighted accuracy [@pmlr-v37-narasimhanb15].

The family of DLPMs is denoted as $\varphi_{DLPM}$. Since these only
consider the diagonal elements, which we want to maximize, we can focus
on only eliciting monotonically increasing DLPMs, meaning that all
elements in $\vec{a}$ are non-negative.

#### Geometry of Space of Diagonal Confusions $\mathcal{D}$ {.unnumbered}

Consider the trivial classifiers that only predict a single class at all
times. The diagonal confusions when only predicting class $i$ are
$\vec{v}_i \in \mathbb{R}^k$ with $\xi_i$ at index $i$ and zero
elsewhere. Note that this is the maximum possible value in index $i$,
because this represents perfectly classifying all points that have a
true class of $i$.

We can consider the space of diagonal confusions, visualized in @fig-diag_geom (taken
from [@NEURIPS2019_1fd09c5f]). The space of $\mathcal{D}$ is strictly
convex, closed, and contained in the box
$[0, \xi_1] \times \dots \times [0, \xi_k]$. We also know that the only
vertices are $\vec{v}_i$ for each $i \in [k]^{(k-1)}$.

![(a) Geometry of space of diagonal confusions for $k=3$. This is a
convex region with three flat areas representing confusions when
restricted to only two classes. (b) Geometry of diagonal confusions when
restricted to classes $k_1$ and $k_2$. Notice how this is identical to
the space of confusion matrices examined in the previous
chapter.](Figures/diag_geometry.png){#fig-diag_geom width="\\textwidth"}

We know that this is strictly convex under the assumption that an object
from any class can be misclassified as any other class. Mathematically,
the assumption is that
$g_{ij}(r) = \mathbb{P} \left[\frac{\eta_i(X)}{\eta_j(X)} \geq r \right]$
$\forall i, j \in [k]$ are continuous and strictly decreasing for
$r \in [0, \infty)$.

We can also define the space of binary classification confusion matrices
confined to classes $k_1$ and $k_2$, which is the 2-D $(k_1, k_2)$
axis-aligned face of $\mathcal{D}$, denoted as $\mathcal{D}_{k_1, k_2}$.
Note that this is strictly convex, since $\mathcal{D}$ itself is
strictly convex, and it has the same geometry as the space of binary
confusion matrices examined in the previous chapter. Therefore, we can
construct a Restricted Bayes Optimal (RBO) classifier for $\psi \in \varphi_{DLPM}$, parameterized
by $\vec{a}$, as follows: 
$$\begin{aligned}
\bar{h}_{k_1, k_2}(\vec{x})= \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
      k_1, \text{ if } a_{k_1} \eta_{k_1}(\vec{x}) \geq a_{k_2} \eta_{k_2}(\vec{x})\\
k_2, \text{ o.w.}
\end{array}
\right\}.
\end{aligned}$$ {#eq-rbo_eq}

We can parameterize the upper boundary of $\mathcal{D}_{k_1, k_2}$,
denoted as $\partial \mathcal{D}^{+}_{k_1, k_2}$, using a single
parameter $m \in [0, 1]$. Specifically, we can construct a DLPM by
setting $a_{k_1} = m$, $a_{k_2} = 1 - m$, and all others to 0. Using
[@eq-rbo_eq], we can get the diagonal confusions, so varying $m$ parameterizes
$\partial \mathcal{D}^{+}_{k_1, k_2}$. The parameterization is denoted
as $\nu(m; k_1, k_2)$.

#### Diagonal Linear Performance Metric Elicitation {.unnumbered}

Suppose the oracle follows a true metric, $\psi$, that is linear and
monotone increasing across all axes. If we consider the composition
$\psi \circ \nu(m; k_1, k_2): [0, 1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, we know it
must be concave and unimodal, because $\mathcal{D}_{k_1, k_2}$ is a
convex set. Therefore, we can find the value of $m$ that maximizes
$\psi \circ \nu(m; k_1, k_2)$ for any given $k_1$ and $k_2$ using a
binary search procedure.

Since the RBO classifier for classes $k_1$ and $k_2$ only rely on the
relative weights of the classes in the DLPM (see [@eq-rbo_eq]), finding
the value of $m$ that maximizes $\psi \circ \nu(m; k_1, k_2)$ gives us
the true relative ratio between $a_{k_1}$ and $a_{k_2}$. Specifically,
from the definition of $\nu$, we know that
$\frac{a_{k_2}}{a_{k_1}} = \frac{1-m}{m}$. We can therefore simply
calculate the ratio between $a_1$ and all other weights to reconstruct
an estimate for the true metric. A python implementation of this
algorithm is provided below.

:::

To use this algorithm for metric elicitation on a real dataset, we need
to supply the "oracle" and "get_d" functions. The oracle function is an
interface to an expert who judges which of two confusion matrices is
better. The get_d function will need to construct a classifier given the
DLPM weights, following the principles of the RBO classifier from [@eq-rbo_eq],
and calculate the confusion matrix from a validation set.

#### Guarantees {.unnumbered}

Using the same oracle feedback noise model from the binary metric
elicitation, we can make the following guarantees:

::: {.callout-note title="proposition"}
::: {#prop-prop_dlpm}
Given $\epsilon, \epsilon_\Omega \geq 0$, and a 1-Lipschitz DLPM
$\varphi^*$ parameterized by $\vec{a}^*$. Then the output $\hat{a}$ of
the DLPM elicitation algorithm after $O((k-1)\log\frac{1}{\epsilon})$
queries to the oracle satisfies
$||\vec{a}^* - \hat{a}||_\infty \leq O(\epsilon + \sqrt{\epsilon_\Omega})$,
which is equivalent to
$||\vec{a}^* - \hat{a}||_2 \leq O(\sqrt{k}(\epsilon + \sqrt{\epsilon_\Omega}))$.
:::
:::

In other words, the maximum difference between the estimate and true
value along any component (indicated by the L-infinity norm) is linearly
bounded by the sum of the epsilon specified by the algorithm and the
square root of the oracle's correctness guarantee ($\epsilon_\Omega$).

### Linear Reward Estimation

How exactly do robots learn human preferences from just the pairwise
comparisons, if they need to learn how to act in the environment itself?
The comparisons in turn help robots learn the reward function of the
human, which allows them to further take actions in real settings.

#### Geometry of Pairwise Comparisons {.unnumbered}

Let's say there are two trajectories $\xi_A$ and $\xi_B$ that might be
taken as the next course of action in any context, like choosing the
next turn, or choosing the next chatGPT response. The robot is offering
both to a human for comparison. To answer which of them is better, the
human would ask themselves if $R(\xi_A)$ or $R(\xi_B)$ is bigger, with
$R(\xi) = w * \phi(\xi)$ being the reward function. In this equation $w$
and $\phi(\xi)$ are vectors of weights and features of the trajectory,
so alternatively, we can express this as:

$$R(\xi) = \begin{bmatrix} w_1 \\ w_2 \\ ... \\ w_N \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} \phi_1(\xi) \\ \phi_2(\xi) \\ ... \\ \phi_N(\xi) \end{bmatrix}$$ {#eq-reward_eq}

If one says that they preferred $\xi_2$ less than $\xi_1$ then it means
$\xi_2 < \xi_1 \implies R(\xi_2) < R(\xi_1) \implies w * \phi(\xi_2) < w * \phi(\xi_1) \implies 0 < w * (\phi(\xi_1) - \phi(\xi_2)) \implies 0 < w * \Phi$.
Alternatively, if one preferred $\xi_2$ more than $\xi_1$, the signs
would be flipped, resulting in $0 > w * \Phi$. The two results can be
represented in the N-dimensional space, where when it is split by the
decision boundary, it creates half-spaces indicating preferences for
each of the sides. For example in @fig-2dcomp we can
see how a query between two objects can split the plain into two halves,
indicating preference towards one of the objects. Such an image can be
extended into bigger dimensions, where a line would become a separating
hyperplane like in @fig-2dcomp.


::: {#fig-2dcomp layout-ncol=2}

![A single query for a comparison between the two objects splits 2D space
into two halves, each of which prefers one of the objects based on
feature weights $w_1$ and $w_2$.](Figures/2D-comp.jpg){width="40%"}

![Extension into 3D space](Figures/3D-comp.png){width="40%"}

Comparison in 2D and 3D
:::

If one is to truly believe the answers of one person, they would remove
everything from the other side of the hyperplane that does not agree
with the received human preference. But since humans are noisy, that
approach is not optimal, thus most applications up-weight the indicated
side of the plane to emphasize that points on that side are better, and
down-weight the other side as they do not agree with the provided
comparison.

How should someone choose which queries to conduct, otherwise, what is
the most informative query sequence? After completing one query, the
next query should be orthogonal to the previous one so that the
potential space consistent with the preferences decreases in half. The
intuition behind that is the potential space has all of the reward
functions that agree with the provided answers, so to find a specific
reward function for a human, decreasing the space narrows down the
possible options. For example, orthogonal query to the query in @fig-2dcomp is
shown in @fig-2dspace. The original query created the blue space, and
a new one created a red space, resulting in a purple intersection of the
two which is still consistent with both of the queries's results. The
image shows that the purple portion is exactly half of the blue portion.

![Creating further comparisons limits the space that agrees with answers
to all of them. The blue area demonstrates a preference for object 1
over object 2. The red area demonstrates a preference for object 3 over
object 4. Combination (purple area) shows the space that is consistent
with both of those preferences.](Figures/2D-space.jpg){#fig-2dspace
width="40%"}

Mathematically, from [@pmlr-v87-biyik18a] this can be expressed as set
$F$ of potential queries $\phi$, where
$F = \{\phi: \phi = \Phi(\xi_A) - \Phi(\xi_B), \xi_A, \xi_B \in \Xi\}$
(defining that a query is the difference between the features of two
trajectories). Using that, the authors define a human update function
$f_{\phi}(w) = \min(1, \exp(I^T\phi))$ that accounts for how much of the
space will still be consistent with the preferences. Finally, for a
specific query, they define the minimum volume removed as
$\min\{\mathbb{E}[1 - f_{\phi}(w)], \mathbb{E}[1 - f_{-\phi}(w)]\}$
(expected size of the two sides of the remaining space after it is split
by a query - purple area in @fig-2dspace), and the final goal is to maximize that amount
over all possible queries since it is optimal to get rid of as much
space as possible to narrow down the options for the reward function:
$\max_{\phi} \min\{ \mathbb{E}[1 - f_{\phi}(w)], \mathbb{E}[1 - f_{-\phi}(w)]\}$.
Effectively this is finding such $\phi$ that maximizes the information
one can get by asking the next comparison query. While this approach
uses minimum volume removed, there can be other metrics inside the
$\max$ function. Some applications like movie recommendations do not
require extra constraints, however in robotics one might want to add
more constraints that satisfy certain rules, so that the resulting query
follows the dynamics of the physical world.

#### Driving Simulator Example {.unnumbered}

The first real example of learning reward functions from pairwise
comparisons is a 2D driving simulator from [@pmlr-v87-biyik18a]. In @fig-car_direct
you can see the setting of a 3-lane road with the orange car being
controlled by the computer.

![The choices presented to a human for feedback are represented by green
and red trajectories. White trajectory demonstrates the lane change of
another vehicle in the space.
[@pmlr-v87-biyik18a]](Figures/car_dir.png){#fig-car_direct width="40%"}

The queries conducted for this problem are two different trajectories
presented to the human, and they are asked to evaluate which one of them
is better. For the features that contribute to the reward function, it
is important to consider that robots might not find some of the
information as informative for the learning process as a human would.
For this example, the underlying features included the distance between
lane boundaries, distance to other cars, and the heading and speed of
the controlled car. The weights toward the last feature were weighted
the highest according to the authors, since it takes a lot of effort for
the car to change or correct its direction.

At the start of the learning process, the car had no direction learned
and was moving all over the road. In the middle of learning after 30
queries, the simulator learned to follow the direction of the road and
go straight but still experienced collisions. After 70 queries, the
simulator learned to avoid collisions, as well as keep the car within
the lane without swerving.

#### Active Learning for Pairwise Comparisons {.unnumbered}

We have discussed that pairwise comparisons should be selected to
maximize the minimum volume of remaining options removed. The question
that can come out of the driving example is does it really matter to
follow that goal or does random choice of queries performs as well? It
turns out that indeed most active learning algorithms (purposefully
selecting queries) over time converge with the performance of the random
query selection, so in long term the performance is similar. However,
what is different is that active learning achieves better performance
earlier, which in time-sensitive tasks can be a critical factor.

One example of such a setting can be exoskeletons for humans as part of
the rehabilitation after surgery [@Li_2021]. Different people have
significantly different walking patterns as well as rehabilitation
requirements, so the exoskeleton needs to adapt to the human as soon as
possible for a more successful rehabilitation. Figure @fig-robotics
demonstrates the difference in the time needed between the two
approaches. In general, in robotics, the time differences that might
seem small to a human might be detrimental to the final performance.

#### Multi-Modal Reward Functions for Pairwise Comparisons {.unnumbered}

What if one is working with multiple people and their responses to the
queries for comparisons? It will be impossible to recover the different
personalities based on the answers, and it might be necessary to conduct
a full ranking before it is clear which responses belonged to which
person, but the underlying theory for the number of comparisons is
non-trivial. For that, the researchers [@myers2021learning] have used
multi-modal models for reward function learning, which allows to account
for different types of valid behaviours and trajectories that can come
from different humans.

![The negotiation setting with two people and three shared items. Each
person has a desired number of items indicated in their utility box.
Alice is the controlled agent that has many different response options
that are illustrated by the approaches different models might take.
[@kwon2021targeted]](Figures/negotiation.png){#fig-negotiation
width="80%"}

An example setting for such type of problem is negotiations
[@kwon2021targeted]. Let's say there are some shared items and two
people with different utilities and desires for items, where each person
only knows their utility. In a specific case of
@fig-negotiation, Bob as a proposing agent and Alice as a
controlled agent who has many different ways of responding to Bob's
proposals. Different methods can be used to design Alice as an AI agent.
The first idea is reinforcement learning, where multiple rounds of
negotiations are done, the model simulates game theory and sees how Bob
reacts. Authors of this setting [@kwon2021targeted] show that over time
the model learns to ask for the same thing over and over again, as Alice
is not trained to be human-like or negotiable, and just tries to
maximize Alice's utility. The second approach is supervised learning,
where the model can be trained on some dataset, learning the history of
negotiations. This results in Alice being very agreeable, which
demonstrates two polar results of the two approaches, and it would be
ideal to find a middle ground and combine both of them. The authors
proposed the Targeted acquisition approach, which is based on active
learning ideas. The model asks diverse questions at different cases and
stages of negotiations like humans, determining which questions are more
valuable to be asked throughout learning. Such an approach ended up in
more fair and optimal results than supervised or reinforcement learning
[@kwon2021targeted].

In conclusion, pairwise comparisons show to be a great way of learning
linear reward functions, but at times present challenges or
incapabilities that can be further improved with additional
incorporations of approaches like Active Learning. That improves many
applications in terms of time spent getting to the result in case of
exoskeleton adjustments, as well as getting to a middle ground between
polar behaviors in applications like negotiations.

### Truthful Preference Elicitation with Adversary

In our study of social choice models in Chapter
[\[2model\]](#2human-decision-making-choice-models){reference-type="ref" reference="2model"}, we study
how axiomatic properties are implemented to prevent strategic
manipulation of a population. This brings us onto the field of
**mechanism design**. At its core, mechanism design is the science of
making rules. The intent in this field is to design systems so that the
strategic behaviour of individuals leads to desirable outcomes. Just
thinking about services on the Internet -- file sharing, reputation
systems, web search, web advertising, email, Internet auctions,
congestion control -- all have to be set up so that an individual's
selfish behavior leads to better outcomes for the entire community. A
more specific example of this is the phenomenon of "bid-sniping" that
was present on eBay in the early 2000s. When people could bid on E-bay,
the rule was that the highest bidder by the end of some specified time
period would get the item. As a result, people would just wait until the
very last minute to bid in order to not raise the price of the item too
early. On the other hand, when Amazon still allowed bidding, they had a
rule that any time a bid was placed it would extend the time of the bid
by ten minutes. This simple difference had drastic effects on bidding
prices over time. Mechanism design develops the theoretical framework
for learning social choices and eliciting truthful preference.

We will cover frameworks that model several scenarios that mechanism
design is usefully applied to: recommendation systems (where users will
selfishly try to stick to their preferences while a planner encourages
exploration); auctions (where bidders will try to maximise their reward
compared to others); and peer grading (where truthful reporting is not
necessarily an incentive for students).

#### Auction Theory {.unnumbered}

##### Single-Item Auctions {#single-item-auctions .unnumbered}

The first problem within auction theory we will consider is the
*single-item auction*. The premise of this problem is that there is a
single item to sell, $n$ bidders (with unknown private valuations of the
item $v_1$, \..., $v_n$). The bidder's individual objective is to
maximize utility: the value $v_i$ of the item subtracted by the price
paid for the item. The auction procedure is standard in the sense that
bids are solicited and the highest bid will win the auction. While the
objective of the individual bidder is clear, there could be a plethora
of different objectives for the auction as a whole. One option could be
to maximize social surplus, meaning the goal is to maximize the value of
the winner. Another objective could be to maximize seller profit which
is the payment of the winner. For simplicity, we can focus on the first
objective where the goal is to maximize social surplus. If we want to
maximize social surplus it turns out that a great way to do this is the
"second-price auction".

###### Maximizing Social Surplus {#maximizing-social-surplus .unnumbered}

In the second-price auction, we will operate under slightly different
conditions. In the second-price auction we 1) solicit sealed bids, 2)
have the winner be the highest bidder, and 3) charger winner the
second-highest bid price. As an example, if the solicited bids are
$b = (2, 6, 4, 1)$ the winner will be that who bid $6$, but will pay a
price of $4$. From here, we can do some equilibrium analysis to try and
learn what the optimal bidding strategy is for each bidder. Let the
amount bidder $i$ bids to be $b_i$, so we have bids
$b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$. How much should bidder $i$ bid? To analyze this,
let us define $t_i = max_{j \neq i} b_j$ which represents the max of the
bids that is not from bidder $i$. There are now two cases to consider:
if $b_i$ \> $t_i$ and if $b_i$ \< $t_i$. In the first case the bidder
$i$ wins, and if the bidder bid $b_i = v_i$, they are guaranteed to have
a positive return on bid. In the other case, they lose the bid and the
net loss is 0 because they don't have to pay. From this we can conclude
that bidder $i$'s dominant strategy is to just bid $b_i = v_i$.
Rigorously proving this is a little bit trickier, but it was shown from
Vickrey in 1961 \[cite\] that truthful bidding is the dominant strategy
in second-price auctions. A corollary of this is that we are maximizing
social surplus since bids are values and the winner is the bidder with
highest valuation.

###### Maximize Seller Profit {#maximize-seller-profit .unnumbered}

If we want to look at things from the perspective of a seller trying to
maximize their profit we need to treat the bidder's bids as uniform
random variables. Consider the example scenario where we have two
bidders each bidding uniformly between 0 and 1. What is the seller's
expected profit? (in this case profit and revenue for the seller are the
same because we assume the seller throws away the item if it doesn't
sell/has no valuation for it).

From there the question now becomes, can we get more expected profit
from the seller's perspective? It turns out there is a design where we
can add a reserve price of $r$ to the second-price auction. The way this
works is we can 1) Insert seller-bid at $r$, 2) solicit bids, 3) pick
the highest bidder, and 3) charge the 2nd-highest bid. In effect, this
is just the second-price auction but with a bid from the seller as well,
at a price of $r$. A lemma, that we won't prove here, is that the
second-price auction with reserve price $r$ still has a dominant
strategy of just being truthful.

Let's now consider what the profit of a second-price auction would be
with two bidders that uniformly bid between 0 and 1 -- but this time we
have a reserve price of $1/2$. To calculate the expected profit we break
down the situation into 3 cases:

-   Case 1:
    $1/2 > v_1 > v_2 \rightarrow 1/4 \text{ probability} \rightarrow  E[\text{profit}] = 0$

-   Case 2:
    $v_1 > v_2 > 1/2 \rightarrow 1/4 \text{probability} \rightarrow E[v2 | case 2] = 2/3$

-   Case 3:
    $v_1 > 1/2 > v_2 \rightarrow 1/2 \text{ probability} \rightarrow 1/2$

Why is $E[v2 | case 2] = 2/3$? If $v_1$ and $v_2$ are greater than
$1/2$, they are evenly spread across the interval, meaning the
expectation will be 1/2 + 1/6 = 2/3. Adding up all these cases we get
$E[profit] = 5/12$. It turns out that second-price auctions with reserve
actually maximize profit in general (for symmetric bidders)!

In the previous section we conclude that second-price auctions with
reserve maximize profit for the seller. In order to prove this, we now
move to the more general topic of asking how should a monopolist divide
good across separate markets. We can make the assumption that the demand
model is a concave revenue $R(q)$ in quantity $q$. Under this
assumption, we can just divide supply into $q = q_a + q_b$ such that
$R'_a(q_a) = R'_b(q_b)$. The idea from here is a theorem from Myerson in
1981 that states an optimal action maximizes \"marginal revenue\".
Consider an example where we have two bidders bidding a uniform value
between 0 and 1. Our revenue curve can now be derived from the offering
price $V(q) = 1 - q$ like so: $R(q) = qV(q) = q - q^2$. Taking the
derivative gives us the marginal revenue $R'(q) = 1-2q$. This means two
things: 1) we want to sell to bidder $i$ with the highest $R'(q_i)$ and
2) we want to sell to bidder $i$ with value at least $1/2$ (if we want a
positive $R'(q_i)$. But this is just a second-price auction with reserve
$1/2$! This means that for symmetric bidders, a second price with
reserve is the optimal auction.

###### What good are auctions? {#what-good-are-auctions .unnumbered}

An interesting topic to discuss is what benefits auctions bring to the
table as opposed to just standard pricing. Online auctions used to be a
lot more popular in the early 2000s and have been completely replaced by
standard online pricing, even on sites like e-bay. While auctions are
slower and have added inherent complexities, they are actually optimal
on paper. Standard pricing on the other is non-optimal; although it is
fast and simpler for buyers. There is actually a way to quantify this:
for pricing $k$ units, the loss is at most $1 / \sqrt{2\pi k}$ of
optimal profit.

Let's consider applications in duopoly platform design. We know that the
optimal auction is second-price with reserve, but what happens when we
introduce competition between two auction platforms? Some important
details related to the revenue of a second-price auction is that a
second-price auction with no reserve and n bidders leads to larger
revenue having an optimal reserve and n - 1 bidders
 [@bulow-klemperer1996]. Additionally, with an entry cost, no reserve is
the optimal strategy for maximizing revenue  [@mcafee-87]. Let's
consider an example of a competing auction system which is Google ads vs
Bing ads. How should an advertiser divide the budget between Google and
Bing? They should give the same budget to both companies. What happens
if Bing raises their prices? Then, the advertising company moves more of
its budget to Google from Bing.

#### Prior-Independent Auctions {#prior-independent-auctions .unnumbered}

The Bulow-Klemperer theorem demonstrates that increased competition can
be more valuable than perfect knowledge of bidders' valuation
distributions. This result provides insight into the potential of
simple, prior-independent auctions to approach the performance of
optimal auctions. The theorem states that for a single-item auction with
bidders' valuations drawn independently from a regular distribution $F$:

::: {.callout-note title="theorem"}
::: {#thm-bulow-klemperer}
Let $F$ be a regular distribution and $n$ a positive integer. Then:
$$E_{v_1,\ldots,v_{n+1} \sim F}[\text{Rev(VA)}(n+1 \text{ bidders})] \geq E_{v_1,\ldots,v_n \sim F}[\text{Rev(OPT}_F)(n \text{ bidders})]$$  {#eq-eq3.64}
where VA denotes the Vickrey auction and $\text{OPT}_F$ denotes the
optimal auction for $F$.
:::
:::

This shows that running a simple Vickrey auction with one extra bidder
outperforms the revenue-optimal auction that requires precise knowledge
of the distribution. It suggests that in practice, effort spent on
recruiting additional bidders may be more fruitful than fine-tuning
auction parameters.

##### The VCG Mechanism {#the-vcg-mechanism .unnumbered}

The VCG mechanism is a cornerstone of mechanism design theory, providing
a general solution for welfare maximization in multi-parameter
environments. The key result is:

::: {.callout-note title="theorem"}
::: {#thm-VCG}
[]{#thm:VCG label="thm:VCG"} In every general mechanism design
environment, there is a dominant-strategy incentive-compatible (DSIC)
welfare-maximizing mechanism.
:::
:::

The VCG mechanism operates as follows:

1.  Given bids $b_1, \ldots, b_n$, where each $b_i$ is indexed by the
    outcome set $\Omega$, the allocation rule is:

    $$x(b) = \arg \max_{\omega \in \Omega} \sum_{i=1}^n b_i(\omega)$$  {#eq-eq3.65}

2.  The payment rule for each agent $i$ is:

    $$p_i(b) = \max_{\omega \in \Omega} \sum_{j \neq i} b_j(\omega) - \sum_{j \neq i} b_j(\omega^*)$$  {#eq-eq3.66}

    where $\omega^* = x(b)$ is the chosen outcome.

The key insight is to charge each agent its "externality" - the welfare
loss inflicted on other agents by its presence. This payment rule,
coupled with the welfare-maximizing allocation rule, yields a DSIC
mechanism.

The VCG mechanism can be interpreted as having each agent pay its bid
minus a \"rebate\" equal to the increase in welfare attributable to its
presence:

$$p_i(b) = b_i(\omega^*) - \left[ \sum_{j=1}^n b_j(\omega^*) - \max_{\omega \in \Omega} \sum_{j \neq i} b_j(\omega) \right]$$  {#eq-eq3.67}

While the VCG mechanism provides a theoretical solution for DSIC
welfare-maximization in general environments, it can be challenging to
implement in practice due to computational and communication
complexities.

##### Combinatorial Auctions {#combinatorial-auctions .unnumbered}

Combinatorial auctions are an important class of multi-parameter
mechanism design problems, with applications ranging from spectrum
auctions to airport slot allocation. In a combinatorial auction:

-   There are $n$ bidders and a set $M$ of $m$ items.

-   The outcome set $\Omega$ consists of allocations
    $(S_1, \ldots, S_n)$, where $S_i$ is the bundle allocated to bidder
    $i$.

-   Each bidder $i$ has a private valuation $v_i(S)$ for each bundle
    $S \subseteq M$.

While the VCG mechanism theoretically solves the welfare-maximization
problem, combinatorial auctions face several major challenges in
practice:

1.  Preference Elicitation: Each bidder has $2^m - 1$ private
    parameters, making direct revelation infeasible for even moderate
    numbers of items. This necessitates the use of indirect mechanisms
    that elicit information on a \"need-to-know\" basis.

2.  Computational Complexity: Even when preference elicitation is not an
    issue, welfare-maximization can be an intractable problem. In
    practice, approximations are often used, hoping to achieve
    reasonably good welfare.

3.  VCG Limitations: The VCG mechanism can exhibit bad revenue and
    incentive properties in combinatorial settings. For example, adding
    bidders can sometimes decrease revenue to zero, and the mechanism
    can be vulnerable to collusion and false-name bids.

4.  Strategic Behavior in Iterative Auctions: Most practical
    combinatorial auctions are iterative, comprising multiple rounds.
    This introduces new opportunities for strategic behavior, such as
    using bids to signal intentions to other bidders.

These challenges make combinatorial auctions a rich and complex area of
study, requiring careful design to balance theoretical guarantees with
practical considerations.

##### Spectrum Auctions {#spectrum-auctions .unnumbered}

Spectrum auctions represent a complex application of combinatorial
auction theory. With n bidders and m non-identical items, each bidder
has a private valuation for every possible bundle of items, making it
impractical to directly elicit all preferences. This necessitates the
use of indirect, iterative mechanisms that query bidders for valuation
information on a "need-to-know" basis, sacrificing some of the desirable
properties of direct mechanisms like dominant strategy incentive
compatibility (DSIC) and full welfare maximization.

The fundamental challenge in spectrum auctions lies in the nature of the
items being sold. There is a dichotomy between items that are
substitutes (where $v(AB) \leq v(A) + v(B))$ and those that are
complements (where $v(AB) > v(A) + v(B))$. Substitute items, such as
licenses for the same area with equal-sized frequency ranges, are
generally easier to handle. When items are substitutes, welfare
maximization is computationally tractable, and the VCG mechanism avoids
many undesirable properties. However, complementary items, which arise
naturally in spectrum auctions when bidders want adjacent licenses,
present significant challenges.

Early attempts at spectrum auctions revealed the pitfalls of naive
approaches. Sequential auctions, where items are sold one after another,
proved problematic as demonstrated by a Swiss auction in 2000. Bidders
struggled to bid intelligently without knowing future prices, leading to
unpredictable outcomes and potential revenue loss. Similarly,
simultaneous sealed-bid auctions, as used in New Zealand in 1990,
created difficulties for bidders in coordinating their bids across
multiple items, resulting in severely suboptimal outcomes.

The Simultaneous Ascending Auction (SAA) emerged as a solution to these
issues and has formed the basis of most spectrum auctions over the past
two decades. In an SAA, multiple items are auctioned simultaneously in
rounds, with bidders placing bids on any subset of items subject to an
activity rule. This format facilitates price discovery, allowing bidders
to adjust their strategies as they learn about others' valuations. It
also allows bidders to determine valuations on a need-to-know basis,
reducing the cognitive burden compared to direct-revelation auctions.

Despite its advantages, the SAA is not without vulnerabilities. Demand
reduction, where bidders strategically reduce their demand to lower
prices, can lead to inefficient outcomes even when items are
substitutes. The exposure problem arises with complementary items, where
bidders risk winning only a subset of desired items at unfavorable
prices. These issues highlight the ongoing challenges in designing
effective spectrum auctions, balancing theoretical guarantees with
practical considerations.

##### Case study: Classroom Peer Grading {#case-study-classroom-peer-grading .unnumbered}

This chapter discusses work by Jason Hartline, Yingkai Li, Liren Shan,
and Yifan Wu at Northwestern University, where researchers examined
mechanism design for the classroom, specifically in terms of the
optimization of scoring rules. They explored peer grading in the
classroom and how to construct a peer grading system that optimizes the
objectives for each stakeholder in the system, including those being
graded, the peer graders, the TAs of the class, and the professor.

Firstly, let's think of the classroom like a computer. We can think of
students as local optimizers; their incentive is to minimize the amount
of work they need to do and maximize the grades that they receive. The
graders are imprecise operators, which means that there is some
uncertainty in their ability to grade the work completed by the
students. The syllabus can be thought of as the rules that map the
actions of the students to the grade they end up receiving in the class.
Our overall goals for this classroom based on these definitions is to
minimize work, maximize learning, and fairly assess the students for the
work that they do  [@jasonH2020].

One basic question that we can examine, is what is the best syllabus
that maximizes our objectives for our classroom design. Some components
of this could include grading randomized exams, grading with partial
credit, group projects, and finally, peer grading, which is the
component that we will be taking a deeper dive into.

The general situation of the peer grading problem is that proper scoring
rules make peer grades horrible  [@jasonH2020]. So we want to be able to
optimize scoring rules and make sure that we are optimizing each
component of the peer grading pipeline.

The main algorithms focused on in this peer grading design paper were
matching peers and TAs to submissions and the grading of those
submissions from the TAs and the peer reviews  [@jasonH2020]. There are
quite a number of advantages to peer grading including that peers are
able to learn from reviewing other people's work, it reduces the work
for the teacher, and improves the turnaround time for assignment
feedback (which are all part of our overarching goals for our mechanism
design for the classroom). But, it is also important to acknowledge the
potential disadvantages of the peer grading system: it is possible that
the peer graders present inaccurate grades and there is student unrest.
This presents us with a challenge: being able to incentivize accurate
peer reviews.

One problem that we run into, when we use the proper scoring rule to
score peer reviews, if the peer graders use the lazy peer strategy,
which means that they always report 80$\%$ for their peer reviews, they
get graded very well using the proper scoring rule algorithm. In fact,
the proper scoring rule says that their peer review is 96$\%$ accurate
 [@jasonH2023]. So how do we incentivize effort in reviews from peer
graders? We use a scoring rule that maximizes the difference in score
between effort or no effort reviews as indicated by the peer reviewers
 [@jasonH2023]. So overall, the analysis of datasets leads to decision
optimizations and, eventually, payoff from those decisions.

To conclude our mechanism design in the classroom discussion, we have
two key takeaways: scoring rules are essential in being able to
understand and analyze data thoroughly, and optimal scoring rules for
binary effort allow us to understand the setting independent of the
dataset  [@jasonH2023].

#### Mutual Information Paradigm {#mutual-information-paradigm .unnumbered}

In this section we discuss an influential new framework for designing
peer prediction mechanisms, the Mutual Information Paradigm (MIP)
introduced by Kong and Schoenebeck [@kongschoenebeck2019]. Traditional
peer prediction approaches typically rely on scoring rules and
correlation between agents' signals. However, these methods often
struggle with issues like uninformed equilibria, where agents can
coordinate on uninformative strategies that yield higher payoffs than
truth-telling. The core idea is to reward agents based on the mutual
information between their report and the reports of other agents.

We consider a setting with $n$ agents, each possessing a private signal
$\Psi_i$ drawn from some set $\Sigma$. The mechanism asks each agent to
report their signal, which we denote as $\hat{\Psi}_i$. For each agent
$i$, the mechanism randomly selects a reference agent $j \neq i$. Agent
$i$'s payment is then calculated as: 
$$MI(\hat{\Psi}_i; \hat{\Psi}_j)$$   {#eq-eq3.68}
where $MI$ is an information-monotone mutual information measure. An
information-monotone $MI$ measure must satisfy the following properties:

-   **Symmetry**: $MI(X; Y) = MI(Y; X)$.

-   **Non-negativity**: $MI(X; Y) \geq 0$, with equality if and only if
    $X$ and $Y$ are independent.

-   **Data processing inequality**: For any transition probability $M$,
    if $Y$ is independent of $M(X)$ conditioned on $X$, then
    $MI(M(X); Y) \leq MI(X; Y)$.

Two important families of mutual information measures that satisfy these
properties are $f$-mutual information and Bregman mutual information.
The $f$-mutual information is defined as:
$$MI_f(X; Y) = D_f(U_{X,Y}, V_{X,Y})$$  {#eq-eq3.69}
 where $D_f$ is an $f$-divergence,
$U_{X,Y}$ is the joint distribution of $X$ and $Y$, and $V_{X,Y}$ is the
product of their marginal distributions. The Bregman mutual information
is defined as: $$BMI_{PS}(X; Y) = \mathbb{E}_{X} [D{PS}(U_{Y|X}, U_Y)]$$  {#eq-eq3.70}
where $D_{PS}$ is a Bregman divergence based on a proper scoring rule
$PS$, $U_{Y|X}$ is the conditional distribution of $Y$ given $X$, and
$U_Y$ is the marginal distribution of $Y$.

The MIP framework can be applied in both single-question and
multi-question settings. In the multi-question setting, the mechanism
can estimate the mutual information empirically from multiple questions.
In the single-question setting, additional techniques like asking for
predictions about other agents' reports are used to estimate the mutual
information.

A key theoretical result of the MIP framework is that when the chosen
mutual information measure is strictly information-monotone with respect
to agents' priors, the resulting mechanism is both dominantly truthful
and strongly truthful. This means that truth-telling is a dominant
strategy for each agent and that the truth-telling equilibrium yields
strictly higher payoffs than any other non-permutation strategy profile.

As research continues to address practical implementation challenges of
designing truthful mechanisms, MIP-based approaches have significant
potential to improve preference elicitation and aggregation in
real-world applications lacking verifiable ground truth.

#### Auction Theory 2 {.unnumbered}

##### Single-Item Auctions {#single-item-auctions-1 .unnumbered}

The first problem within auction we will consider is the *single-item
auction*. In this problem setup, there is a single item to sell and $n$
bidders each with unknown private valuations of the item
$v_1, \ldots, v_n$,

[^1]: Here, the "$\sup$\" operation refers to the *supremum*, which is
    the largest value that a certain set can take on, whereas "$\inf$\"
    would refer to the *infimum*, or the smallest value a certain set
    can take on.

### Application: Guiding Human Demonstrations in Robotics

A strong approach to learning policies for robotic manipulation is
imitation learning, the technique of learning behaviors from human
demonstrations. In particular, interactive imitation learning allows a
group of humans to contribute their own demonstrations for a task,
allowing for scalable learning. However, not all groups of demonstrators
are equally helpful for interactive imitation learning.

The ideal set of demonstrations for imitation learning would follow a
single, optimal method for performing the task, which a robot could
learn to mimic. Conversely, *multimodality*, the presence of multiple
optimal methods in the demonstration set, is challenging for imitation
learning since it has to learn from contradicting information for how to
accomplish a task.

A common reason for multimodality is the fact that different people
often subconsciously choose different paths for execution, as
illustrated in @fig-multimodalexecution.

![Examples of two different ways to insert a nut onto a round peg. The
orange demonstration picks up the nut from the hole while the blue
demonstration picks up the nut from the side
[@gandhi2022eliciting]](Figures/multimodal_peg.png){#fig-multimodalexecution
width="50%"}

Gandhi et al. [@gandhi2022eliciting] identifies whether demonstrations
are compatible with one another and offer an active elicitation
interface to guide humans to provide better demonstrations in
interactive imitation learning. Their key motivation is to allow
multiple users to contribute demonstrations over the course of data
collection by guiding users towards compatible demonstrations.

To identify whether a demonstration is "compatible" with a base policy
trained with prior demonstrations, the researchers measure the
*likelihood* of demonstrated actions under the base policy, and the
*novelty* of the visited states. Intuitively, low likelihood and low
novelty demonstrations should be excluded since they represent
conflicting modes of behavior on states that the robot can already
handle, and are therefore incompatible. This concept of compatibility is
used for filtering a new set of demonstrations and actively eliciting
compatible demonstrations.

In the following subsections, we describe the process of estimating
compatibility and active elicitation in more detal.

#### Estimating Compatiblity {.unnumbered}

We want to define a compatibility measure $\mathcal{M}$, that estimates
the performance of policy $\pi_{base}$ that is retrained on a union of
$\mathcal{D}_{base}$, the known base dataset, and $\mathcal{D}_{new}$,
the newly collected dataset. To define this compatibility measure in a
way that is easy to compute, we can use two interpretable metrics:
likelihood and novelty.

The likelihood of actions $a_{new}$ in $\mathcal{D}_{new}$ is measured
as the negative mean squared error between actions predicted by the base
policy and this proposed action:

$$\begin{aligned}
    likelihood(s_{new}, a_{new}) = -\mathbb{E}[|| \pi_{base}(s_{new}) - a_{new} ||^2_2].
\end{aligned}$$  {#eq-eq3.61}

The novelty of the state $s_{new}$ in $\mathcal{D}_{new}$ is the
standard deviation in the predicted actions under base policy:

$$\begin{aligned}
    novelty(s_{new}) = \mathrm{Var}[\pi_{base}(s_{new})].
\end{aligned}$$  {#eq-eq3.62}

We can plot likelihood and novelty on a 2D plane, as shown in @fig-likelihood_novelty, and identify thresholds on
likelihood and novelty, denoted as $\lambda$ and $\eta$ respectively.
Intuitively, demonstrations with low likelihood in low novelty states
should be excluded, because this indicates that there is a conflict
between the base behavior and the new demonstration due to
multimodality. Note that in high novelty states, the likelihood should
be disregarded because the base policy does not have a concrete idea for
how to handle these states anyways so more data is needed.

incompatible operators

The final compatibility metric, parameterized by the likelihood and
novelty thresholds $\lambda$ and $\eta$, is
$\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{D}_{base}, (s_{new}, a_{new})) \in [0, 1]$,
defined as:

$$\begin{aligned}
    \mathcal{M} = \begin{cases} 
        1 - \min(\frac{\mathbb{E}[|| \pi_{base}(s_{new}) - a_{new} ||^2_2]}{\lambda}, 1) & \text{ if } \text{novelty}(s_{new}) < \eta \\
        1 & \text{ otherwise }
       \end{cases}.
\end{aligned}$$  {#eq-eq3.63}

Note that $\lambda$ and $\eta$ need to be specified by hand. This is
accomplished by assuming the ability to collect *a priori incompatible*
demonstrations to identify reasonable thresholds that remove the most
datapoints in the incompatible demonstrations while keeping the most
datapoints in the compatible demonstrations.

#### Case Studies with Fixed Sets {.unnumbered}

The researchers evaluate the utility of the compatibility metric on
three tasks: placing a square nut on a square peg, placing a round nut
on a round peg, and opening a drawer and placing a hammer inside. For
each task, they train a base policy using a "proficient" operator's
demonstration while sampling trajectories from other operators for the
new set.

The naive baseline is to use all datapoints while the
$\mathcal{M}$-Filtered demonstrations use the compatibility metric to
filter out incompatible demonstrations. The results are presented in
@tbl-m_filter_table. As you can see, M-filtering results in
equal or greater performance despite using less data than the naive
baseline, demonstrating the effectiveness of compatibility-based
filtering.

#### Actively Eliciting Compatible Demonstrations {.unnumbered}

In the previous section, we assume access to a dataset that has already
been collected, and we see how filtering out incompatible demonstrations
helps improve performance. However, when collecting a new dataset, it
would be better to ensure that operators collect compatible
demonstrations from the start, allowing us to retain as much data as
possible for training.

To actively elicit compatible demonstrations, the researchers set up a
pipeline for live feedback and examples. At the start, operators are
given a task specification and some episodes to practice using the
robot. Then, the active elicitation process begins, as shown in @fig-active_elicitation. Each operator is shown some
rollouts of the base policy to understand the style of the base
operator. Next, the operator provides a demonstration similar to the
ones they were shown. As they record their demonstrations, the interface
provides online feedback, with green indicating compatible actions and
red indicating incompatible actions. If the number of incompatible
state-action pairs (ones where $\mathcal{M}$ is zero) exceeds 5% of the
demonstration length, the demonstration is rejected. However, to provide
corrective feedback, the interface shows the areas of the demonstration
with the highest average incompatibility and also provides an expert
demo that shows what should actually be done. Demonstrators can use this
feedback to provide more compatible demonstrations moving forward.

This process helps improve the demonstration quality in both simulation
and real experiments, as show in @tbl-active_elicitation_results. Specifically, on the real
results, active elicitation outperformed the base policy by 25% and
naive data collection by 55%. Overall, active elicitation is a powerful
tool to ensure that data collected for imitation learning improves the
quality of the learned policy.

#### Limitations and Future Work for Active Elicitation {.unnumbered}

A fundamental limitation of eliciting compatible demonstrations is the
fact that the "base" demonstrator is considered the ground truth. When
the base demonstrator specifies a preference, all other demonstrators
must abide by it, even if they have strong preferences against it. For
instance, when pouring milk and cereal into a bowl, different people
have different preferences for what is the correct order, but active
elicitation forces all demonstrators to follow the initial preference of
the base operator. The researchers hope that future work can enable
users to override the default demonstration set and follow a base
behavior that better aligns with their preferences. This could enable
multiple modes of behavior to be collected in data while only following
a user's specified preference instead of attempting to collapse all
modes into a single policy.

Looking forward, active elicitation provides a foundation for allowing
robots to query humans about the type of data needed, enabling more
efficient data collection through transparency.

### Conclusion

In summary, this chapter has explored the complexities and innovations
in interactive learning as applied to large models within robotics. It
begins by investigating pairwise comparisons and their role in
efficiently learning linear reward functions from large datasets,
overcoming limitations in supervised learning. When combined with active
learning techniques, these comparisons supply timely, targeted, and
context-appropriate feedback, enhancing performance in time-critical
applications like exoskeleton adjustments during rehabilitation.

We then shift to imitation learning or inverse reward learning from
demonstrations, emphasizing the difficulties introduced by multimodal
demonstration sets. active elicitation approaches to compile compatible
demonstrations, streamlining the learning process by guiding users to
provide more valuable, steady examples are incredibly promising,
however, to tackling this issue. This method shows promise in refining
the interactive imitation learning data collection pipeline, enabling
more capable and effective robotic training.

Additionally, the chapter examines the integration of foundation models
into robotics, highlighting the transformative innovations of R3M and
Voltron. R3M's pre-training on diverse human activities dramatically
improves robotic manipulation with minimal supervision. Meanwhile,
Voltron builds on these capabilities by incorporating language-driven
representation learning for remarkably adaptable and nuanced robotic
task performance. These models represent significant leaps in robotics
while opening new frontiers for future research and applications.
