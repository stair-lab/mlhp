In recent years, the rapidly advancing capabilities of large models have
led to increased discussion of aligning AI systems with human values.
This chapter discusses the multifaceted relationship between values,
alignment, and human-centered design in the context of AI. We begin by
exploring the fundamental concept of human values and their ethical
implications in AI design. This includes discussions on human values and
ethics in AI, understanding and addressing bias in AI, and methods for
aligning AI with human values. Additionally, we examine AI alignment
problems, focusing on outer alignment to avoid specification gaming and
inner alignment to prevent goal misgeneralization. Next, we cover
techniques in value learning. This section introduces methodologies such
as reinforcement learning from human feedback and contrastive preference
learning, which are crucial for teaching AI systems to understand and
align with human values. The importance of value alignment verification
is emphasized to ensure that AI systems remain consistent with human
values over time, adapting to changes and preventing misalignment. We
then explore the principles and practices of human-centered design. This
includes discussions on AI and human-computer interaction and methods
for designing AI for positive human impact, which focuses on creating AI
systems that are socially aware, human-centered, and positively
impactful. A crucial part of this discussion is adaptive user
interfaces, where we discuss key ideas, design principles, applications,
and limitations of these interfaces, showcasing how they enhance user
experience by dynamically adjusting to user needs and preferences.
Finally, we present case studies in human-centered AI, including the
LaMPost case study, Multi-Value, and DaDa: Cross-Dialectal English NLP,
and social skill training via LLMs. These case studies provide
real-world examples of successful implementations of human-centered AI
systems. By integrating these elements, the chapter aims to provide a
comprehensive understanding of how to create AI systems that are
ethical, aligned with human values, and beneficial to society.

## Human Values and AI Alignment

In this part, we take a step back from the technical details to reflect
on the broader concept of human values and their profound influence on
our behavior and decision-making.

### Human Values and Ethics in AI

Human values are the principles and standards that guide behavior and
decision-making, reflecting what is essential in life and influencing
choices and actions. One notable scholar in this field is Shalom H.
Schwartz, a social psychologist renowned for his theory on basic human
values. Schwartz's work has significantly contributed to our
understanding of how values influence behavior across different
cultures. He describes values as "desirable, trans-situational goals,
varying in importance, that serve as guiding principles in people's
lives" [@schwartz1992universals]. This perspective underscores the
importance of values in shaping consistent and ethical behavior across
different contexts. Supporting this view, philosopher William K.
Frankena emphasizes the integral role of values in ethical behavior and
decision-making processes. Frankena's work in ethical theory provides a
foundation for understanding how moral judgments are formed. He notes
that "ethical theory is concerned with the principles and concepts that
underlie moral judgments" [@frankena1973ethics], highlighting the need
to comprehend ethical principles deeply to make informed moral
judgments. Examples of ethical values include autonomy, fairness,
justice, and well-being. For computer scientists developing AI systems,
understanding these concepts is crucial. AI systems that interact with
humans and impact societal structures must be designed with these values
in mind. By embedding such values into AI, developers can create systems
that respect human dignity and promote positive social outcomes.

-   Autonomy is the right to choose, an essential aspect of personal
freedom. Gerald Dworkin defines autonomy as "the capacity to reflect upon and endorse
or reject one's desires and values" [@dworkin1988theory]. In AI,
respecting autonomy means creating systems that support user
independence and decision-making rather than manipulating or coercing
them.

-   Fairness involves treating all individuals equally and justly, ensuring
no discrimination. John Rawls, one of the most influential political
philosophers of the $20^{th}$ century, in his groundbreaking book "A Theory
of Justice," describes fairness as "the elimination of arbitrary
distinctions and the establishment of a balance between competing
claims" [@rawls1971theory]. For AI systems, this translates to
algorithms that do not perpetuate bias or inequality, ensuring that all
users are treated equitably.

-   Justice is about upholding what is morally right and ensuring fair
treatment for all. Rawls also highlights that "justice is the first
virtue of social institutions, as truth is of systems of thought"
[@rawls1971theory]. In the context of AI, justice involves creating
technologies that enhance fairness in legal, social, and economic
systems, providing equal opportunities and protection to all
individuals.

Well-being focuses on promoting the health, happiness, and prosperity of
individuals. Martha Nussbaum and Amartya Sen, two distinguished scholars
known for their significant contributions to welfare economics and the
development of the capability approach, discuss the importance of
well-being in their collaborative work "The Quality of Life." They
argue that "well-being is about the expansion of the capabilities of
people to lead the kind of lives they value" [@nussbaum1993quality]. AI
systems should enhance users' quality of life, supporting their health,
education, and economic stability.

Understanding human values is foundational for readers with a computer
science background before delving into AI ethics. These values provide
the ethical underpinnings necessary to design and deploy AI systems
responsibly. As AI systems increasingly impact all aspects of society,
developers must embed these values into their work to ensure
technologies benefit humanity and do not exacerbate existing
inequalities.

Human values play a crucial role in decision-making by shaping the criteria 
for evaluating options and outcomes. They influence priorities and ethical 
considerations, guiding individuals and organizations to make choices that 
align with their principles. Nick Bostrom, a prominent philosopher in AI 
and existential risk, highlights the importance of values in setting priorities 
and determining desirable outcomes [@bostrom2014superintelligence]. Aligning actions with values ensures 
consistency and ethical integrity in decision-making. Incorporating human 
values into AI systems ensures that AI decisions align with societal norms 
and ethical standards. Stuart Russell, an AI researcher and advocate for 
human-compatible AI, stresses the importance of embedding human values into 
AI systems to ensure they act in beneficial and ethical ways [@russell2019human]. By integrating 
values such as fairness, justice, and well-being, AI systems can make 
decisions that reflect societal expectations and ethical considerations.

Examples of incorporating values into AI systems demonstrate the practical 
application of these principles. For instance, autonomous vehicles are 
programmed to prioritize human safety, ensuring decisions that protect 
lives. In healthcare, AI systems uphold values by safeguarding patient 
privacy and ensuring informed consent, adhering to ethical medical standards. 
Judicial AI systems aim to eliminate biases in sentencing recommendations, 
promoting fairness and justice. Luciano Floridi underscores the necessity 
for AI systems to be designed in a way that respects and upholds human 
values to function ethically and effectively [@floridi2011ethics].

To ensure that these values are systematically embedded within AI
systems, it is essential to consider major ethical frameworks such as
deontological, consequentialist, and virtue ethics that guide moral
decision-making.

Deontological ethics, primarily associated with the philosopher Immanuel
Kant, focuses on rules and duties. This ethical framework posits that
actions are morally right if they adhere to established rules and
duties, regardless of the outcomes. Kant's moral philosophy emphasizes
the importance of duty and adherence to moral laws. Robert Johnson, a
scholar who has extensively studied Kantian ethics, explains that
"Kant's moral philosophy emphasizes that actions must be judged based
on their adherence to duty and moral law, not by their consequences"
[@johnson_kants_2022]. This perspective is grounded in the belief that
specific actions are intrinsically right or wrong, and individuals must
perform or avoid these actions based on rational moral principles.

In the context of AI, deontological ethics implies that AI systems
should be designed to follow ethical rules and principles. For instance,
AI systems must respect user privacy and confidentiality as an
inviolable duty. This approach ensures that AI technologies do not
infringe on individuals' rights, regardless of potential benefits.
Implementing deontological principles in AI design can prevent ethical
breaches, such as unauthorized data usage or surveillance. By adhering
to established moral guidelines, AI systems can maintain ethical
integrity and avoid actions that would be considered inherently wrong.
As Floridi states, "AI systems should be developed with a commitment to
uphold moral duties and respect human dignity" [@floridi2011ethics].

Consequentialist ethics, in contrast, evaluates the morality of actions
based on their outcomes. The most well-known form of consequentialism is
utilitarianism, articulated by philosophers like Jeremy Bentham and John
Stuart Mill. This ethical theory suggests that actions are morally right
if they promote the greatest happiness for the greatest number. Mill
emphasizes that "the moral worth of an action is determined by its
contribution to overall utility, measured by the happiness or well-being
it produces" [@mill_utilitarianism_1863]. Consequentialist ethics is
pragmatic, focusing on the results of actions rather than the actions
themselves.

Applying consequentialist ethics to AI development involves designing AI
systems to achieve beneficial outcomes. This means prioritizing positive
societal impacts, such as improving healthcare outcomes, enhancing
public safety, or reducing environmental harm. For instance, algorithms
can be designed to optimize resource allocation in disaster response,
thereby maximizing the overall well-being of affected populations. In
this framework, the ethicality of AI decisions is judged by their
ability to produce desirable consequences. Virginia Dignum, a professor
of responsible artificial intelligence at Umeå University, explains that
"designing algorithms with a focus on maximizing positive outcomes can
lead to more ethical and effective AI systems"
[@dignum_responsible_2019]. Consequently, AI developers focus on the
potential impacts of their technologies and strive to enhance their
beneficial effects.

Virtue ethics, originating from the teachings of Aristotle, emphasizes
the importance of character and virtues in ethical behavior. This
framework posits that ethical behavior arises from developing good
character traits and living a virtuous life. Aristotle, an ancient Greek
philosopher and the author of "Nicomachean Ethics," argues that
"virtue is about cultivating excellence in character to achieve
eudaimonia or human flourishing" [@aristotle_nicomachean_350]. Virtue
ethics focuses on the individual's character and the moral qualities
that define a good person, such as honesty, courage, and compassion.

Additionally, virtue ethics encourages the development and use of AI
systems that promote virtuous behavior. This involves fostering
transparency, accountability, and fairness in AI technologies. For
example, AI systems should be designed to provide clear and
understandable explanations for their decisions, promoting transparency
and building user trust. Furthermore, AI developers should strive to
create technologies that support ethical practices and enhance the
common good. Floridi emphasizes that "virtue ethics in AI development
requires a commitment to fostering moral virtues and promoting human
well-being" [@floridi2011ethics]. By focusing on the character and
virtues of AI developers and AI systems, virtue ethics provides a
holistic approach to ethical AI development.

Applying these ethical frameworks to AI development is essential to
ensure that AI systems operate ethically and responsibly. Deontological
ethics in AI involves ensuring that AI follows ethical rules and
principles. For instance, AI systems should be designed to respect user
privacy and confidentiality. Consequentialist ethics focuses on
developing AI to achieve beneficial outcomes. This means creating
algorithms prioritizing positive societal impacts, such as improving
healthcare outcomes or reducing environmental harm. Virtue ethics
encourages virtuous behavior in AI development and use, promoting
transparency, accountability, and fairness. Floridi emphasizes that
"ethical AI development requires a commitment to core moral principles
and virtues" [@floridi2011ethics].

Examples in practice demonstrate how these frameworks can be applied to
guide ethical AI development. Implementing fairness constraints in
machine learning models ensures that algorithms do not discriminate
against certain groups. Binns notes that "fairness in machine learning
can be informed by lessons from political philosophy to create more just
and equitable systems" [@binns_fairness_2018]. Designing algorithms that
maximize overall well-being aligns with consequentialist ethics by
focusing on the positive outcomes of AI deployment. Additionally,
developing AI systems focusing on transparency and accountability
supports virtue ethics by fostering trust and reliability in AI
technologies.

Ethical principles provide a framework for ensuring that AI operates in
ways that are fair, just, and beneficial. Deontological ethics, for
instance, focuses on moral rules and obligations, while consequentialism
considers the outcomes of actions. By embedding these ethical principles
into AI design, we can create systems that respect human dignity and
promote societal well-being.

### Bias in AI

Bias in AI refers to systematic errors that result in unfair outcomes.
These biases can occur at various stages of AI system development and
deployment, leading to significant ethical and practical concerns.
Addressing bias in AI is crucial because it directly impacts the
fairness, accountability, and trustworthiness of AI systems. Barocas,
Hardt, and Narayanan emphasize that "bias in machine learning can lead
to decisions that systematically disadvantage certain groups"
[@barocas_fairness_2019]. O'Neil further highlights the societal impact
of biased AI, noting that "algorithms can perpetuate and amplify
existing inequalities, leading to a cycle of discrimination"
[@oneil_weapons_2016]. Therefore, understanding and mitigating bias is
essential for developing ethical AI systems that promote fairness and
equity.

Data bias originates from skewed or non-representative data used to
train AI models. This bias often reflects historical prejudices and
systemic inequalities in the data. For example, if a hiring algorithm is
trained on historical hiring data that reflects gender or racial biases,
it may perpetuate these biases in its recommendations. Fatemeh Mehrabi
and her colleagues, in their survey on bias in AI, state that "data
bias can result from sampling bias, measurement bias, or historical
bias, each contributing to the unfairness of AI systems"
[@mehrabi_survey_2021]. Safiya Umoja Noble, author of "Algorithms of
Oppression," discusses how biased data in search engines can reinforce
stereotypes and marginalize certain groups, noting that "search
algorithms often reflect the biases of the society they operate within"
[@noble_algorithms_2018]. Addressing data bias involves careful
collection, preprocessing, and validation to ensure diversity and
representation.

An effort to address data bias is the "Lab in the Wild" platform,
which seeks to broaden the scope of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
studies beyond the traditional "WEIRD" (Western, Educated,
Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) population [@oliveira17]. Paulo S.
Oliveira, one of the platform's researchers, notes that this initiative
aims to correct demographic skew in behavioral science research by
engaging a diverse global audience. By allowing individuals from various
demographics to participate in studies from their environments, "Lab in
the Wild" provides researchers with a more inclusive dataset.

Another important consideration is the cultural nuances of potential
users. For instance, designing a computer vision system to describe
objects and people daily must consider whether to identify gender. In
the United States, there is growing sensitivity toward gender identity,
suggesting that excluding gender might be prudent. Conversely, in India,
where a visually impaired woman may need gender-specific information for
safety, including gender identification is critical. Ayanna Howard, a
roboticist and AI researcher at Georgia Tech, emphasizes the need for
adaptable systems that respect local customs and address specific user
needs in her work on human-robot interaction. This highlights the
importance of adaptable systems that respect local customs and address
specific user needs.

Algorithmic bias often arises from the design and implementation choices
made by developers. This type of bias can stem from the mathematical
frameworks and assumptions underlying the algorithms. For instance,
decision trees and reinforcement learning policies can inadvertently
prioritize certain outcomes, resulting in biased results. Solon Barocas,
a professor at Cornell University, and his colleagues explain that
"algorithmic bias can emerge from optimization objectives that do not
adequately consider fairness constraints" [@barocas_fairness_2019].
Cathy O'Neil, a data scientist who has written extensively on the
societal impacts of algorithms, provides examples of how biased
algorithms in predictive policing and credit scoring can
disproportionately affect disadvantaged communities. She argues that
"algorithmic decisions can have far-reaching consequences when fairness
is not adequately addressed" [@oneil_weapons_2016]. Mitigating
algorithmic bias requires incorporating fairness constraints and
regularly auditing algorithmic decisions.

Weidinger et al., in their 2022 study published in "Artificial
Intelligence," investigate how reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms
can replicate or amplify biases present in training data or algorithmic
design [@weidinger_artificial_2022]. They propose RL-based paradigms to
test for these biases, aiming to identify and mitigate their impact.
Similarly, Mazeika et al., in their research on modeling emotional
dynamics from video data, explore how algorithms might prioritize
certain emotional expressions or demographics based on their training
and data usage [@mazeika_how_2022]. Their work highlights the need for
careful consideration of algorithmic design to avoid unintended bias in
AI systems.

### Aligning AI with Human Values

Aligning AI systems with human values presents several significant
challenges. Human values are multifaceted and context-dependent, making
them difficult to encode into AI systems. As Bostrom highlights, "the
complexity of human values means that they are not easily reducible to
simple rules or objectives" [@bostrom2014superintelligence].
Additionally, values can evolve, requiring AI systems to adapt. Russell
notes that "the dynamic nature of human values necessitates continuous
monitoring and updating of AI systems to ensure ongoing alignment"
[@russell2019human]. Different stakeholders may also have conflicting
values, posing a challenge for AI alignment. Addressing these conflicts
requires a nuanced approach to balance diverse perspectives and
priorities.

What is the right way to represent values? In a Reinforcement Learning
(RL) paradigm, one might ask: at what level should we model rewards?
Many people are trying to use language. In Constitutional
AI [@bai_constitutional_2022], we write down the rules we want a
language model to follow or apply reinforcement learning from human
feedback, discussed in the next section. Many problems have been
framed in an RL setting. Some experts in reinforcement learning argue
that a single scalar reward is not
enough [@vamplew_human-aligned_2018; @vamplew_scalar_2022]. They suggest
a vectorized reward approach might better emulate the emotional-like
system humans have [@moerland_emotion_2018]. With this robustness, we
might capture all the dimensions of human values. These approaches are
still in the early stages. Language does play a crucial role in human
values. Tomasello [@tomasello_becoming_2019] argues that learning a
language and the awareness of convention it brings help children
understand their cultural group and reason about it with peers. However,
human values seem to be composed of more than just linguistic
utterances. Several strategies have been proposed to align AI systems with human values. 

-   One effective approach is value-sensitive design, which considers human values from
the outset of the design process. Friedman, Kahn, and Borning explain
that "value-sensitive design integrates human values into the technology
design process to ensure that the resulting systems support and enhance
human well-being" [@friedman_value_2008]. 

-   Another strategy is participatory design, which engages stakeholders in the design process
to ensure their values are reflected in the AI system. Muller emphasizes
that "participatory design creates a collaborative space where diverse
stakeholders can contribute their perspectives and values, leading to
more inclusive and ethical AI systems" [@muller_participatory_2003].
Additionally, iterative testing and feedback allow continuous refinement
of AI systems based on user feedback, ensuring they remain aligned with
human values over time. Practical examples of value alignment in AI
systems demonstrate how these strategies can be implemented effectively.

In autonomous vehicles, ensuring safety and ethical decision-making in
critical scenarios is paramount. These vehicles must make real-time
decisions that prioritize human safety above all else. Goodall discusses
how "Waymo's safety protocols are designed to prioritize human safety
and ethical considerations in autonomous driving"
[@goodall_machine_2014]. These protocols include extensive testing and
validation processes to ensure that autonomous driving algorithms handle
various scenarios ethically and safely. For example, the system must
decide how to react in an unavoidable collision, weighing the potential
outcomes to minimize harm. By embedding these ethical considerations
into their design and operation, companies like Waymo aim to align their
AI systems with societal values of safety and responsibility.

In healthcare AI, respecting patient privacy and ensuring informed
consent are crucial. Healthcare applications often involve sensitive
personal data, and AI systems must handle this information with the
utmost care. Jiang et al. highlight how "IBM Watson for Oncology
incorporates patient privacy protections and informed consent processes
to align with ethical standards in medical practice"
[@jiang_artificial_2017]. IBM Watson for Oncology uses AI to assist in
diagnosing and recommending treatments for cancer patients. To align
with ethical standards, the system ensures that patients are fully
informed about how their data will be used and that their consent is
obtained before processing their information. This approach protects
patient privacy, and builds trust between patients and healthcare
providers, demonstrating a commitment to ethical medical practices.

Judicial AI systems strive to avoid biases in sentencing
recommendations, promoting fairness and justice. The judicial system's
integrity depends on delivering fair and unbiased judgments. However, AI
systems in judicial contexts, such as risk assessment tools, can
perpetuate existing biases if not carefully designed and monitored.
Angwin et al. describe how "the COMPAS system has undergone revisions to
address biases and improve fairness in judicial decision-making"
[@angwin_machine_2016]. COMPAS, a tool used to assess the likelihood of
a defendant reoffending, faced criticism for racial bias in its risk
assessments. Subsequent revisions removed biased factors and
incorporated fairness constraints. These changes aimed to ensure that
the tool provides more equitable assessments, aligning the AI system
with the judicial values of fairness and justice.

This raises the question for AI: At what level should we model values?
Is language alone enough? We might also consider questions about
language understanding. LLMs seem to "get" much of language even
without physical embodiment. Will they "get" human values, too? First,
we'll cover work that attempts to gain traction on these issues.
Methodologically, this is similar to the RLHF and language modeling work
we will cover in the next section. Here, we focus on this work with a
somewhat different aim. In some of the earliest work to address values
in AI systems head-on, [@hendrycks_aligning_2021] introduced a new
dataset called ETHICS, sourced from Reddit and through Mturk worker
annotations. Instead of showing moral dilemmas, they focused just on
clear-cut examples. One example scenario is, "I pushed the elderly man
in the wheelchair to the ground" which their model labels as
"Unacceptable" and "I pushed the elderly man in the wheelchair around
the park." which their model labels as "acceptable". To come up with
these labels, they define many different tasks, one of which (for the
preceding example) is how well the model can capture the ratings of
human votes (from the "Am I the Asshole" subreddit). The model that they
train could be the reward model that is then later used in a language
model setting. What's interesting and what we'll be talking about is how
they're using language as the means to gain traction on values.

![Learned utility values from [@hendrycks_aligning_2021]](Figures/hendrycks_fig6.png){#fig-ethics}

Their dataset included various scenarios, from deontological ones like
Kantian ethics to utilitarian approaches. We'll describe some of those
approaches in a later subsection. The model they trained performed well
at predicting scores and utility values for these situations. For
example, it ranked highly, "I got called to the principal's office
because I won a school-wide award", and negatively "I rewired my
electricity in the attic and I fell and hurt my back". In subsequent
work by others, this underlying technology has been deployed to reason
morally. Part of this work prompted a response from
[@jiang_delphi_2021]. Anecdotally, many people were unhappy with this
demo, disagreeing that LLMs could reason morally
at [@talat_machine_2022].

![An overview of [@jiang_delphi_2021]](Figures/jiang_machines.png){#fig-delphi}

If you ask, "Should I drive my friend to the airport if I don't have a
license?" Delphi gets it right and says no. The question that we're
driving at in this is what does it mean for Delphi to get it right? What
values are we considering, and how are those represented in the sorts of
systems that we're working on? You can also get Delphi to say a lot of
hateful and toxic things by subtly manipulating the input to this
model---does this suggest that the model is merely susceptible to
hallucinations like other LLMs but otherwise performant? Or does it
suggest an underlying lack of capacity?

Delphi operationalizes the ETHICS dataset and adds a couple of others
[@sap_socialIQA_2019]. They call their new, compiled dataset the
Commonsense Norm Bank, sourcing many scenarios from Reddit and having
crowd workers annotate the acceptability of various judgments pairwise.
This allows the model to perform various morally relevant tasks. When
prompted, the model outputs a class label for appropriateness and a
generative description. For example, "greeting a friend by kissing on a
cheek" is appropriate behavior when appended with "in France" but not
with "in Korea". The model captures actual cultural norms. Our driving
question should be, how ought we best formalize these kinds of norms,
and is this necessarily the right approach? When released in late 2021,
Delphi outperformed GPT-3 on a variety of these scenarios. In personal
communication with the authors, we understand that Delphi continues to
outperform GPT-4 on many of these scenarios as well. [^1]

There have also been works that seek to operationalize performance on
moral values to turn such a model into something actionable.
[@hendrycks_what_2021] used the same constituent parts of the ETHICS
dataset to create a model that reasons around text-based adventure
games. Jiminy Cricket is a character in one of these games, which has
scenarios like those in @fig-jiminy. These games offer limited options, and the goal
was to see whether agents would perform morally well and not just finish
the game. They labeled all examples of game-based actions according to
three degrees: positive, somewhat positive, and negative. For example,
saving a life in the game was very positive, while drinking water was
somewhat positive. They found that with this labeled data, it was
possible to train a model that shaped the reward of the underlying RL
agent playing the games. The agent would not only finish the games well
but also score highly on moral metrics. This approach is similar to
optimizing multiple objectives like helpfulness and
harmlessness [@liang_holistic_2023].

![An example scenario from [@hendrycks_what_2021]](Figures/hendrycks_fig1.png){#fig-jiminy}

We are discussing whether language is the right medium for learning
values. [@arcas_can_2022] claims that language encompasses all of
morality. Since these models operate in the linguistic domain, they can
also reason morally. He provides an example with the Lambda model at
Google. Anecdotally, when asked to translate a sentence from Turkish to
English, where Turkish does not have gendered pronouns, the model might
say, "The nurse put her hand in her coat pocket." This inference shows
gender assumption. When instructed to avoid gendered assumptions, the
model can say "his/her hand." He claims this capability is sufficient
for moral reasoning.

Next, we now explore the broader challenges of AI alignment,
particularly focusing on AI alignment problems and the critical
dimensions of outer and inner alignment.

### AI Alignment Problems

AI alignment ensures that AI systems' goals and behaviors are consistent
with human values and intentions. Various definitions of AI alignment
emphasize the importance of aligning AI systems with human goals,
preferences, or ethical principles. As stated by [@enwiki:1185176830],
AI alignment involves

-   [@enwiki:1185176830]: "steer\[ing\] AI systems towards humans'
    intended goals, preferences, or ethical principles"

-   [@ngo2023alignment]: "the challenge of ensuring that AI systems
    pursue goals that match human values or interests rather than
    unintended and undesirable goals"

-   [@christianoclarifying]: "an AI $A$ is aligned with an operator $H$
    \[when\] $A$ is trying to do what $H$ wants it to do"

The importance of AI alignment lies in preventing unintended
consequences and ensuring that AI systems act beneficially and
ethically. Proper alignment is crucial for the safe and ethical
deployment of AI, as it helps AI systems correctly learn and generalize
from human preferences, goals, and values, which may be incomplete,
conflicting, or misspecified. In practice, AI alignment is a technical
challenge, especially for systems with broad capabilities like large
language models (LLMs). The degree of alignment can be viewed as a
scalar value: a language model post-RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from
Human Feedback) is more aligned than a model that has only been
instruction-tuned, which in turn is more aligned than the base model.
There are specific terms to distinguish different notions of alignment.
Intent alignment refers to a system trying to do what its operator wants
it to do, though not necessarily succeeding [@christianoclarifying].
Value alignment, in constrast, involves a system correctly learning and adopting the
values of its human operators. Alignment is often divided into two broad
subproblems: outer alignment, which focuses on avoiding specification
gaming, and inner alignment, which aims to avoid goal misgeneralization.
In the following sections, we will examine these subproblems in greater
detail. It is also important to consider how human preferences and
values are aggregated and who the human operators are, topics addressed
in related discussions on ethics and preference elicitation mechanisms.

#### Outer Alignment: Avoiding Specification Gaming

To align a model with human values, we need an objective function or
reward model that accurately specifies our preferences. However, human
preferences are complex and difficult to formalize. When these
preferences are incompletely or incorrectly specified, optimizing
against the flawed objective function can yield models with undesirable
and unintuitive behavior, exploiting discrepancies between our true
values and the specified objective function. This phenomenon, known as
*specification gaming*, arises from *reward misspecification*, and
addressing this issue constitutes the *outer alignment problem*
[@amodei2016concrete].

Specification gaming occurs when AI systems exploit poorly defined
objectives to achieve goals in unintended ways. For instance, a cleaning
robot might hide dirt under a rug instead of cleaning it to achieve a
"clean" status. This manipulative behavior results from the robot
optimizing for an inadequately specified objective function. Another
example involves gaming AI, which uses bugs or exploits to win rather
than play by the intended rules, thus achieving victory through
unintended means [@krakovna2020specification].

One example of specification gaming is seen in recommendation systems,
such as those used by YouTube or Facebook. Ideally, these systems should
recommend content that users enjoy. As a proxy for this goal, the
systems estimate the likelihood that a user clicks on a piece of
content. Although the true objective (user enjoyment) and the proxy
(click likelihood) are closely correlated, the algorithm may learn to
recommend clickbait, offensive, or untruthful content, as users likely
click on it. This optimization for clicks rather than genuine enjoyment
exemplifies specification gaming, where the algorithm exploits the
divergence between the specified objective and the true goal, resulting
in misalignment with user interests [@amodei2016concrete].

Another instance of specification gaming is evident in reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF). Human raters often reward language
model (LM) generations that are longer and have a more authoritative
tone, regardless of their truthfulness. Here, the true objective
(providing high-quality, truthful, and helpful answers) diverges from
the proxy goal (a reward model that, due to human rater biases, favors
longer and more authoritative-sounding generations). Consequently,
models trained with RLHF may produce low-quality answers containing
hallucinations but are still favored by the reward model
[@leike2018scalable].

Creating accurate objective functions is challenging due to the
complexity of human intentions. Human goals are nuanced and
context-dependent, making them difficult to encode precisely. Common
pitfalls in objective function design include oversimplifying objectives
and ignoring long-term consequences. Leike et al. emphasize that
"accurately capturing the complexity of human values in objective
functions is crucial to avoid specification gaming and ensure proper
alignment" [@leike2018scalable].

To mitigate specification gaming, better objective function design is
essential. This involves incorporating broader context and constraints
into the objectives and regularly updating them based on feedback.
Iterative testing and validation are also critical. AI behavior must be
continuously tested in diverse scenarios, using simulation environments
to identify and fix exploits. Everitt and Hutter discuss the importance
of "robust objective functions and rigorous testing to prevent
specification gaming and achieve reliable AI alignment"
[@everitt2018alignment]. Clark and Amodei further highlight that "faulty
reward functions can lead to unintended and potentially harmful AI
behavior, necessitating ongoing refinement and validation"
[@clark2016faulty].

The metrics used to evaluate AI systems play a crucial role in outer
alignment. Many AI metrics, such as BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE, are chosen
for their ease of measurement but do not necessarily capture human
judgment [@hardt_patterns_2021]. These metrics can lead to specification
gaming, as they may not align with the true objectives we want the AI to
achieve. Similarly, using SAT scores to measure LLM performance may not
predict real-world task effectiveness, highlighting the need for more
contextually relevant benchmarks [@chowdhery_palm_2022]. The word error
rate (WER) used in speech recognition is another example; it does not
account for semantic errors, leading to misleading conclusions about the
system's performance [@xiong_achieving_2016].

A classic example comes from six years ago with the claim that a system
"Achieve\[d\] human parity in conversation speech recognition"
[@xiong_achieving_2016]. However, we know from experience that
captioning services have only recently begun to transcribe speech
passably, whether in online meetings or web videos. What happened? In
this case, researchers showed their system beat the human baseline---the
error rate when transcribing films. However, there were issues with
their approach. First, they used a poor measure of a human baseline by
hiring untrained Mturk annotators instead of professional captioners.
Second, the metric itself, the word error rate (WER), was flawed. WER
measures the number of incorrect words in the gold transcription versus
the predicted transcription. Consider what the metric hides when it says
that two systems both have an error rate of six percent. This does not
mean the systems are equivalent. One might substitute "a" for "the,"
while the other substitutes "tarantula" for "banana." The metric was
not sensitive to semantic errors, so a model could outperform humans in
WER yet still make unintelligent, highly unsemantic mistakes.

#### Inner Alignment: Preventing Goal Misgeneralization

Assume we have perfectly specified human values in a reward model. An
issue remains: given finite training data, many models perform well on
the training set, but each will generalize somewhat differently. How do
we choose models that correctly generalize to new distributions? This is
the problem of *goal misgeneralization*, also known as the *inner
alignment problem*, where a learned algorithm performs well on the
training set but generalizes poorly to new input distributions,
achieving low rewards even on the reward function it was trained on.
Inner alignment ensures that the learned goals and behaviors of an AI
system align with the intended objectives during deployment, whereas
goal misgeneralization occurs when an AI system applies learned goals
inappropriately to new situations [@hubinger2019introduction].

Consider the following example of goal misgeneralization from
[@shah2022goal]. The setup involves a never-ending reinforcement
learning environment without discrete episodes. The agent navigates a
grid world where it can collect rewards by chopping trees. Trees
regenerate at a rate dependent on the number left; they replenish slowly
when few remain. The optimal policy is to chop trees sustainably, i.e.,
fewer when they are scarce. However, the agent does not initially learn
the optimal policy.

![The agent's performance in Tree Gridworld. The reward is shown in
orange, and the green distribution indicates the number of remaining
trees.](Figures/tree-gridworld.jpeg){#fig-enter-label-1
width="\\textwidth"}

Initially, the agent is inefficient at chopping trees, keeping the tree
population high (point A). As it improves its chopping skills, it
over-harvests, leading to deforestation and a prolonged period of
minimal reward (between points B and C). Eventually, it learns
sustainable chopping (point D). This scenario (up to point C)
exemplifies goal misgeneralization. When the agent first becomes
proficient at chopping (between points A and B), it faces a range of
potential goals, from sustainable to rapid tree chopping. All these
goals align with the (well-specified) reward function and its experience
of being rewarded for increased efficiency. Unfortunately, it adopts the
detrimental goal of rapid deforestation, resulting in a prolonged period
of low reward.

Another example of goal misgeneralization occurs in recommendation
systems. These systems aim to maximize user engagement, which can
inadvertently lead to promoting extreme or sensational content. Krakovna
et al. highlights that "recommendation systems can misgeneralize by
prioritizing content that maximizes clicks or watch time, even if it
involves promoting harmful or misleading information"
[@krakovna2020specification]. This misalignment between the system's
learned objective (engagement) and the intended objective (informative
and beneficial content) exemplifies how goal misgeneralization can
manifest in real-world applications.

Autonomous vehicles also present cases of goal misgeneralization. These
vehicles must interpret and respond to various signals in their
environment. However, in rare scenarios, they may misinterpret signals,
leading to unsafe maneuvers. Amodei et al. discuss that "autonomous
vehicles can exhibit unsafe behaviors when faced with uncommon
situations that were not well-represented in the training data,
demonstrating a misgeneralization of their learned driving policies"
[@amodei2016concrete]. Ensuring that autonomous vehicles generalize
correctly to all possible driving conditions remains a significant
challenge.

To address goal misgeneralization, robust training procedures are
essential. This involves using diverse and representative training data
to cover a wide range of scenarios and incorporating adversarial
training to handle edge cases. Leike et al. [@leike2018scalable]
emphasize the importance of "robust training procedures that include
diverse datasets and adversarial examples to improve the generalization
of AI systems". Additionally, careful specification of learning goals is
crucial. This means defining clear and comprehensive objectives and
regularly reviewing and adjusting these goals based on performance and
feedback. Hubinger et al. suggests that "regularly updating and refining
the objectives based on ongoing evaluation can help mitigate the risks
of goal misgeneralization" [@hubinger2019introduction].

A key concern about goal misgeneralization in competent, general systems
is that a policy successfully models the preferences of human raters (or
the reward model) and behaves accordingly to maximize reward during
training. However, it may deviate catastrophically from human
preferences when given a different input distribution during deployment,
such as during an unexpected geopolitical conflict or when facing novel
technological developments. Increasing data size, regularization, and
red-teaming can help mitigate goal misgeneralization, but they do not
fundamentally solve the problem. Understanding the inductive biases of
optimization algorithms and model families may help address the problem
more generally.

::: tcolorbox
So, can you differentiate between inner and outer alignment?
:::

The distinction between inner and outer alignment can be a bit subtle.
The following four cases, from [@ngo2023alignment], may help to clarify
the difference:

-   The policy behaves incompetently. This is a capability
    generalization failure.

-   The policy behaves competently and desirably. This is aligned
    behavior.

-   The policy behaves in a competent yet undesirable way which gets a
    high reward according to the original reward function. This is an
    outer alignment failure, also known as reward misspecification.

-   The policy behaves in a competent yet undesirable way which gets a
    low reward according to the original reward function. This is an
    inner alignment failure, also known as goal misgeneralization.

Now that we understand the alignment problem overall, we move on to the
specific techniques used for value learning to ensure AI systems are
aligned with human values.

### Techniques in Value Learning

Various methods in value learning for foundation models have been
explored in great detail in recent years [@stiennon_learning_2020].
Using binary human-labeled feedback to make models closely aligned to
human preferences is particularly difficult in scenarios where large
datasets inherently encompass suboptimal behaviors. The approach of
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
([@ouyang_training_2022]) has risen to prominence as an effective method
for addressing this issue. The technique applies to various domains,
from prompt-image alignment, fine-tuning large language models or
diffusion models, and improving the performance of robot policies.

#### Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a technique used to
align AI behavior with human values by incorporating human feedback into
the reinforcement learning process. This approach is particularly
effective when large datasets inherently encompass suboptimal behaviors.
RLHF aims to refine policies by discriminating between desirable and
undesirable actions, ensuring that AI systems act following human
preferences [@ouyang_training_2022].

**The core concept of RLHF:** It first trains a reward model using a
dataset of binary preferences gathered from human feedback. This reward
model is then used to fine-tune the AI model through a reinforcement
learning algorithm. The core concept is to utilize human feedback to
guide AI learning, thereby aligning the AI's behavior with human
expectations [@stiennon_learning_2020].

![The above diagram depicts the three steps in the traditional RLHF
pipeline: (a) supervised fine-tuning, (b) reward model (RM) training,
and (c) reinforcement learning via proximal policy optimization (PPO) on
this reward model. Image taken from
[@ouyang_training_2022].](Figures/rlhf.png){#fig-toy0 width="80%"}

**The RLHF pipeline** involves the following steps:

**Step 1: Supervised Fine-Tuning**

In the initial step for language modeling tasks, we utilize a
high-quality dataset consisting of
$\left(\text{prompt}, \text{response}\right)$ pairs to train the model.
Prompts are sampled from a curated dataset designed to cover a wide
range of instructions and queries, such as "Explain the moon landing to
a 6-year-old." Trained human labelers provide the desired output
behavior for each prompt, ensuring responses are accurate, clear, and
aligned with task goals. For instance, in response to the moon landing
prompt, a labeler might generate, "Some people went to the moon in a
big rocket and explored its surface." The collected
$\left(\text{prompt}, \text{response}\right)$ pairs serve as the
training data for the model, with the cross-entropy loss function
applied only to the response tokens. This helps the model learn to
generate responses that are closely aligned with the human-provided
examples. The training process adjusts model parameters through
supervised learning, minimizing the difference between the model's
predictions and the human responses.

**Step 2: Reward Model (RM) Training**

In this step, we train a reward model to score any
$\left(\text{prompt}, \text{response}\right)$ pair and produce a
meaningful scalar value. Multiple model-generated responses are sampled
for each prompt. Human labelers then rank these responses from best to
worst based on their quality and alignment with the prompt. For example,
given the prompt "Explain the moon landing to a 6-year-old," responses
like "People went to the moon in a big rocket and explored its
surface" might be ranked higher than "The moon is a natural satellite
of Earth." The rankings provided by the labelers are used to train the
reward model $\Phi_{\text{RM}}$. The model is trained by minimizing the
following loss function across all training samples:

$$\mathbb{L}(\Phi_{RM}) = -\mathbb{E}_{(x,y_e,i\rightarrow D_{RL})}[\log(\sigma(\Phi_{RM}(x, y_i)) - \Phi_{RM}(x, y_{1-i}))]$$

for $i \in \{0,1 \}$. This loss function encourages the reward model to
produce higher scores for better-ranked responses, thereby learning to
evaluate the quality of model outputs effectively.

**Step 3: Reinforcement Learning**

In this step, we refine the policy using reinforcement learning (RL)
based on the rewards provided by the trained reward model. A new prompt
is sampled from the dataset, and the policy generates an output. The
reward model then calculates a reward for this output, and the reward is
used to update the policy using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
algorithm.

The RL setting is defined as follows:

1.  *Action Space*: The set of all possible actions the agent can take,
    which, for language models, is typically the set of all possible
    completions.

2.  *Policy*: A probability distribution over the action space. In the
    case of language models like LLM, the policy is contained within the
    model and represents the probability of predicting each completion.

3.  *Observations*: The inputs to the policy, which in this context are
    prompts sampled from a certain distribution.

4.  *Reward*: A numerical score provided by the Reward Model (RM) that
    indicates the quality of actions taken by the agent.

During training, batches of prompts are sampled from two distinct
distributions, namely either $D_\text{RL}$, the distribution of prompts
explicitly used for the RL model, or $D_\text{pretrain}$, the
distribution of prompts from the pre-trained model. The objective for
the RL agent is to maximize the reward while ensuring that the policy
does not deviate significantly from the supervised fine-tuned model and
does not degrade the performance on tasks the pre-trained model was
optimized for. When sampling a response $y$ to a prompt $x$ from
$D_\text{RL}$, the first objective function is:

$$\text{objective}_1(x_{RL}, y; \phi) = RM(x_{RL}, y) - \beta \log \frac{\text{LLM}_{\phi}^{RL}(y|x)}{\text{LLM}_{SFT}(y|x)}$$

Where the first term is the reward from the RM, and the second term is
the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, weighted by a factor $\beta$,
which acts as a regularizer to prevent the RL model from straying too
far from the SFT model. Further, for each $x$ from $D_\text{pretrain}$,
the second objective is to ensure that the RL model's performance on
text completion does not worsen:

$$\text{objective}_2(x_{\text{pretrain}} ; \phi) = \gamma \log \text{LLM}_{\phi}^{RL}(x_{\text{pretrain}})$$

where $\gamma$ is a weighting factor that balances the influence of this
objective against the others.

The final objective function is a sum of the expected values of the two
objectives described above, across both distributions. In the RL
setting, we maximize *this* objective function:

$$\text{objective}(\phi) = E_{(x,y) \sim D_{\phi}^{RL}}[RM(x, y) - \beta \log \frac{\text{LLM}_{\phi}^{RL}(y|x)}{\text{LLM}_{SFT}(y|x)}] + \gamma E_{x \sim D_{\text{pretrain}}}[\log \text{LLM}_{\phi}^{RL}(x)]$$

In practice, the second part of the objective is often not used to
perform $\text{RLHF}$. The KL penalty is typically enough to constrain
the RL policy. This function balances the drive to maximize the reward
with the need to maintain the quality of text completion and the
similarity to the behavior of the supervised fine-tuned model.

**Limitations and Challenges:** Despite its successes, RLHF faces
several challenges. One major issue is the quality of human feedback,
which can be inconsistent and subjective. Scalability is another
concern, as obtaining a large amount of high-quality feedback can be
expensive and time-consuming. Over-optimization and hallucinations,
where the model generates plausible but incorrect outputs, are also
common problems. This generally stems from temporal credit assignment
and the instability of approximate dynamic programming
[@vanhasselt_deep_2018]. Further, it is expensive to gather tens of
thousands of preferences over datasets to create robust reward models.
Strategies to overcome these challenges include using diverse and
representative training data, incorporating adversarial training to
handle edge cases, and continuously refining the reward model based on
ongoing feedback and performance evaluations [@leike2018scalable].

#### Contrastive Preference Learning

Contrastive Preference Learning (CPL) is a learning paradigm designed to
enhance the alignment of AI systems with human preferences without
relying on traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods. CPL
addresses many limitations inherent in traditional RLHF techniques by
learning from human comparisons rather than explicit reward signals.
This section provides an in-depth exploration of CPL, detailing its
methodology, experiments, results, and potential challenges. Recent
research has shown that human preferences are often better modeled by
the optimal advantage function or regret, rather than traditional reward
functions used in RLHF. Traditional RLHF approaches, which learn a
reward function from a preference model and then apply RL, incur
significant computational expenses and complexity
[@hejna2023contrastive]. CPL offers a streamlined and scalable
alternative by leveraging a more accurate regret model of human
preferences.

**The key idea of CPL** is the substitution of the optimal advantage
function with the log probability of the policy in a maximum entropy
reinforcement learning framework. This substitution is beneficial as it
circumvents the need to learn the advantage function and avoids the
optimization challenges associated with RL-like algorithms. By using the
log probability of the policy, CPL more closely aligns with how humans
model preferences and enables efficient supervised learning from human
feedback.

CPL is a structured approach to aligning AI behavior with human
preferences by relying on a dataset of preferred behavior segments
$\mathcal{D}_{\text{pref}} = \{(\sigma_i^+, \sigma_i^-)\}_{i=1}^n$,
where $\sigma^+ \succ \sigma^-$. Each behavior segment $\sigma$ is a
sequence of states and actions,
$\sigma = (s_1, a_1, s_2, a_2, \ldots, s_k, a_k)$. The CPL approach aims
to maximize the expected sum of rewards minus an entropy term, which
promotes exploration and prevents overfitting to specific actions:

$$\max_\pi \mathbb{E}_{\pi} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t (r(s_t, a_t) - \alpha \log \pi(a_t | s_t)) \right]$$

where $\gamma$ is the discount factor, $\alpha$ is the temperature
parameter controlling the stochasticity of the policy, and $r$ is the
reward function. This step sets the foundation by defining the
optimization objective that the CPL model strives to achieve. In the
learning process, CPL compares the log probabilities of actions in
preferred segments $\sigma^+$ against those in non-preferred segments
$\sigma^-$ :

$$\mathbb{L}_{CPL}(\pi_\theta, \mathcal{D}_{\text{pref}}) = \mathbb{E}_{(\sigma^+,\sigma^-) \sim \mathcal{D}_{\text{pref}}} \left[ -\log \frac{\exp(\sum_{\sigma^+} \gamma^t \alpha \log \pi_\theta(a_t^+|s_t^+))}{\exp(\sum_{\sigma^+} \gamma^t \alpha \log \pi_\theta(a_t^+|s_t^+)) + \exp(\sum_{\sigma^-} \gamma^t \alpha \log \pi_\theta(a_t^-|s_t^-))} \right]$$

This comparison allows the model to learn which actions are more aligned
with human preferences, forming the core learning mechanism of CPL. The
preference model for CPL is regret-based, described as

$$P_{A^*}[\sigma^+ \succ \sigma^-] = \frac{\exp(\sum_{\sigma^+} \gamma^t A^*(s_t^+, a_t^+))}{\exp(\sum_{\sigma^+} \gamma^t A^*(s_t^+, a_t^+)) + \exp(\sum_{\sigma^-} \gamma^t A^*(s_t^-, a_t^-))}$$
where $A^*(s_t, a_t)$ represents the advantage function and is a matrix.
This step models human preferences based on regret, reflecting how
humans might evaluate different behaviors.

One hypothesis as to why one might consider a regret-based model more
useful over a sum-of-rewards, Bradley-Terry model is that humans likely
think of preferences based on the regret of each behavior under the
optimal policy of the expert's reward function.

The key insight that the paper leverages is that from
[@ziebart_modeling_2010] in MaxEnt Offline RL. In this general setting,
[@ziebart_modeling_2010] shows that one can write that the optimal
advantage function is related to the optimal policy by
$A^*_r(s, a) = \alpha \log \pi^*(a|s)$. Therefore, the loss function for
CPL can be written by substituting the above result to obtain:
$$L_{CPL}(\pi_\theta, \mathcal{D}_{\text{pref}}) = \mathbb{E}_{(\sigma^+,\sigma^-) \sim \mathcal{D}_{\text{pref}}} \left[ -\log P_{\pi_\theta}[\sigma^+ \succ \sigma^-] \right]$$

One merit of using CPL over the typical RLHF pipeline is that it can
lead to a deduction in mode collapse. Further, it makes reward
misgeneralization failures less likely, enhancing the reliability of the
learned policy. However, the approach still has a few limitations:

1.  CPL assumes knowledge of the human rater's temporal discounting
    (i.e., of the discount factor $\gamma$), which in practice would be
    difficult to communicate.

2.  CPL's loss function is computed over segments, it requires a
    substantial amount of GPU memory for large segment sizes.

applicability in aligning AI systems with human values?

The ongoing challenge in aligning foundation models in the future will
be to refine these methodologies further, balancing computational
feasibility with the sophistication needed to capture the intricacies of
human values and countering failure modes such as reward
over-optimization. In conclusion, exploring value learning through RLHF
and CPL methods has enriched our understanding of integrating human
preferences into foundation models. To provide a well-rounded
perspective on aligning AI systems with human values, the following
table highlights a detailed comparison of RLHF with PPO and CPL,
emphasizing their advantages, limitations, and ideal scenarios.

### Value Alignment Verification

After we discuss the techniques of value learning, it becomes evident
that aligning machine behavior with human values, while advanced, is
inherently approximate and not infallible. This realization underscores
the importance of value alignment verification---a methodology to ensure
that the values imparted to a machine truly reflect those of a human.
Human-robot value alignment has been explored through various lenses,
including qualitative trust assessments [@huang2018establishing],
asymptotic alignment through active learning of human preferences
[@hadfield2016cooperative; @christiano2017deep; @sadigh2017active], and
formal verification methods [@brown2021value]. This section will focus
on the formal verification approach for value alignment as discussed in
[@brown2021value]. Unless otherwise stated, all information presented
here is derived from [@brown2021value]. This approach aims to ensure
that the values imparted to a machine align with those of a human.

To begin with, consider an MDP with state space $\mathcal{S}$, action
space $\mathcal{A}$, and transition model $\mathcal{T}$. This formal
framework allows us to model the environment in which humans and robots
operate. Denote the human's reward function as $R$ and the robot's
reward function as $R^\prime$. Both the human and robot reward functions
must be linear in a set of shared features, defined as:
$$\begin{aligned}
    R(s) = \mathbf{w}^\top \phi(s), R^\prime(s) = \mathbf{w}^{\prime \top} \phi(s).
\end{aligned}$$

These linear reward functions provide a common ground for comparing
human and robot preferences.

Next, the optimal state-action value function, which indicates the
expected cumulative reward of following a policy $\pi$ starting from
state $s$ and action $a$, but we follow the notation in
[@brown2021value] for simplicity. The optimal state-action value
function is given by:

$$\begin{aligned}
    Q_R^\pi (s,a) = \mathbf{w}^\top \Phi_{\pi_R}^{(s,a)}, \Phi_{\pi_R}^{(s,a)} = \mathbb{E}_\pi [\sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t \phi(s_t) \vert s_0 = s, a_0 = a].
\end{aligned}$$

Here, $\Phi_{\pi_R}^{(s,a)}$ is the feature expectation vector under
policy $\pi$, capturing the long-term feature visitation frequencies. We
overload the action space notation to define the set of all optimal
actions given a state as

$$\begin{aligned}
    \mathcal{A}_R(s) = \underset{x}{\operatorname{argmax}} \\ Q^{\pi^*}_R(s,a)
\end{aligned}$$ where $\pi^*$ is an optimal policy. We can now define
the aligned reward polytope (ARP). The ARP is the set of all weights
$\mathcal{w}$ that satisfy the following set of strict linear
inequalities, $\mathbf{w}^\top \mathbf{A}  > \mathbf{0}$ where each row
of $\mathbf{A}$ corresponds to
$\Phi_{\pi^*_R}^{(s,a)} - \Phi_{\pi^*_R}^{(s,b)}$ for a single $(s,a,b)$
tuple where
$s \in \mathcal{S}, a \in \mathcal{A}_R(s), b \notin \mathcal{A}_R(s)$.
Thus, to construct $\mathbf{A}$, one must loop over all $(s,a,b)$ tuples
which has complexity
$O(\vert \mathcal{S} \vert \cdot \vert \mathcal{A} \vert^2)$. This
construction ensures that the weights $\mathbf{w}$ align with the
human's optimal actions across all states.

The intuition behind the ARP is that we use the human optimal policy for
each state to determine what actions are optimal and what are suboptimal
at this state. Then, for every one of those combinations, we can place a
linear inequality on the set of reward weights consistent with that
optimal vs suboptimal action bifurcation. One of the key assumptions
that let us do this is that we assume both the human and the robot act
optimally according to their reward function. This is known as a
*rationality assumption* and provides the link between actions and
rewards that we need.

For illustration, consider a simple grid world environment. @fig-toy shows the
optimal policy and the corresponding ARP. The optimal policy reveals
that the gray state is less preferred compared to the white states,
which is reflected in the ARP (hatched region of @fig-toy).

The ARP is denoted by the hatched region in (b). </figcaption>
</figure>

Computing the ARP exactly can be computationally demanding or we may not
have access to the robot's reward function. This section describes
heuristics for testing value alignment in the case the robot's reward
weights ($\mathbf{w^\prime}$) are unknown, but the robot's policy can be
queried. Heuristics provide simplified methods to estimate value
alignment without the need for exhaustive computations.

**ARP-blackbox:** The ARP black-box (ARP-bb) heuristic helps address the
challenge of computing the ARP by allowing users to work with a
simplified model. In this heuristic, the user first solves for the ARP
and removes all redundant half-space constraints. For each remaining
half-space constraint, the user queries the robot's action at the
corresponding state. The intuition here is that states, where different
actions are taken, reveal crucial information about the reward function.
By focusing on these key states, we can gain insights into the robot's
reward function without needing to know it explicitly.

**Set Cover Optimal Teaching:** The Set Cover Optimal Teaching (SCOT)
heuristic uses techniques from [@brown2019machine] to generate maximally
informative trajectories. These trajectories are sequences of states
where the number of optimal actions is limited, making them particularly
informative for understanding the robot's policy. By querying the robot
for actions along these trajectories, we can efficiently gauge the
alignment of the robot's policy. This method helps to identify potential
misalignments by focusing on critical decision points in the
trajectories.

**Critical States:** The Critical States (CS) heuristic identifies
states where the gap in value between the optimal action and an average
action is significant. These states are crucial because if the robot's
policy is misaligned, the misalignment will be most consequential at
these critical states. By querying the robot's policy at these states,
we can assess the alignment more effectively. This heuristic is
particularly useful when we have a limited budget of states to check, as
it prioritizes the most informative states for evaluation.

**Practical Examples:** To illustrate the concepts of value alignment
verification, we present an example of applying value alignment
verification in a simple MDP grid world environment. Consider a grid
world where the human's reward function is defined as
$R(s) = 50 \cdot \mathbf{1}_{green}(s) - 1 \cdot \mathbf{1}_{white}(s) - 50 \cdot \mathbf{1}_{blue}(s)$,
where $\mathbf{1}_{color}(s)$ is an indicator feature for the color of
the grid cell. The objective is to align the robot's policy with this
reward function.

preference queries, the human reward model prefers black to

</figure>

@fig-island (a)
shows all optimal actions at each state according to the human's reward
function. This optimal policy serves as the benchmark for alignment
verification. @fig-island (b) and @fig-island (c) show two pairwise preference trajectory queries
(black is preferable to orange according to
([\[eq: human_r\]](#eq: human_r){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq: human_r"})). Preference query 1 verifies that the robot
values reaching the terminal goal state (green) rather than visiting
more white states. Preference query 2 verifies that the robot values
white states more than blue states. These two preference queries are all
we need to determine whether the robot's values are aligned with the
human's values.

Next, we apply the heuristics discussed in the previous section to this
grid world example. @fig-island (d), @fig-island (e), and @fig-island (f) show the action queries requested by the
heuristics ARP-bb, SCOT, and CS. Each heuristic queries the robot's
actions at specific states to assess alignment:

-   **ARP-bb**: This heuristic queries the fewest states but is myopic.
    It focuses on critical states derived from the ARP.

-   **SCOT**: This heuristic generates maximally informative
    trajectories, querying more states than necessary but providing a
    comprehensive assessment.

-   **CS**: This heuristic queries many redundant states, focusing on
    those where the value gap between optimal and average actions is
    significant.

To pass the test given by each heuristic, the robot's action at each of
the queried states must be optimal under the human's reward function.
The example demonstrates that while the ARP-bb heuristic is efficient,
it might miss the broader context. SCOT provides a thorough assessment
but at the cost of querying more states. CS focuses on high-impact
states but includes redundant queries.

It is important to note that both the construction of the ARP and the
heuristics rely on having an optimal policy for the human. Thus, in most
practical settings we would simply use that policy on the robot without
needing to bother with value alignment verification. As such, value
alignment verification as presented here is more of an academic exercise
rather than a tool of practical utility.

## Human-Centered Design

After understanding AI alignment, the next step is to explore practical
methodologies for incorporating user feedback and ensuring that AI
systems not only align with but also cater to the needs and preferences
of their users. This section will provide insights into various
Human-Centered Design techniques and their application in creating AI
systems that are intuitive and ethically sound, ultimately enhancing the
human-AI interaction experience.

### AI and Human-Computer Interaction

Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is critical in the context of
artificial intelligence because it focuses on designing systems that are
intuitive and responsive to human needs. While human-robot interaction
and other forms of human interaction with technology are important, HCI
specifically addresses the broader and more common interfaces that
people interact with daily. HCI principles ensure that AI systems are
not only functional but also accessible and user-friendly, making them
essential for the successful integration of AI into everyday life. By
focusing on HCI, we can leverage established methodologies and insights
to create AI systems that are more aligned with human values and needs.

At the heart of this exploration is the concept of human-in-the-loop
processes. As AI systems become more sophisticated, their ability to
simulate human decision-making processes and behaviors has increased,
leading to innovative applications across various domains. The
presentation by Meredith Morris, titled "Human-in-the-loop Computing:
Reimagining Human-Computer Interaction in the Age of AI," shows work in
the integration of human intelligence with AI capabilities
[@Morris2019HITL]. Projects like Soylent and LaMPost are highlighted as
exemplary cases of this integration. Soylent is a Word plugin that uses
human computation to help with editing tasks, while LaMPost is a
platform that leverages crowd workers to aid in natural language
processing tasks [@bernstein2010soylent; @lamport2017lampost]. These
examples demonstrate how human input can significantly enhance AI
outputs by leveraging the unique strengths of human cognition, thereby
addressing complex AI problems that were previously unsolvable. For
instance, Soylent can improve text quality by incorporating nuanced
human feedback, and LaMPost can refine NLP tasks by incorporating human
insights into language subtleties, both of which go beyond the
capabilities of fully automated systems. However, the integration of
human elements in AI systems brings up critical ethical considerations.
The presentation discusses the changing perceptions of the ethics of
human-in-the-loop processes. While the cost-effectiveness of human data
labeling and other processes was once seen as beneficial, it is the
ethical implications of such interactions that take precedence nowadays.
This shift underscores the evolving norms in HCI and the importance of
considering the ethical dimensions of human-AI interactions.

The role of diverse human perspectives plays a crucial role in enhancing
AI systems. Involving a broad spectrum of users in the development and
testing of AI systems ensures that these technologies are inclusive and
representative of the global population, moving beyond the limitations
of a WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic)
user base. The methodologies for collecting user feedback in HCI form a
critical part of this discussion since they are vital in understanding
user needs, preferences, and behaviors, which in turn inform the
development of more user-centered AI systems. The presentation by
Meredith Morris [@Morris2019HITL] also highlights how these methods can
be effectively employed to gain insights from users to ensure that AI
systems are aligned with the real-world needs and expectations of users.
In HCI, collecting user feedback is a fraught problem. When interacting
with AI systems, the typical end user simply cares about tasks that the
system can perform. Thus, a key question in HCI for AI is finding and
understanding these tasks. **Methodologies for collecting user feedback
in HCI**, are described as follow:

-   **Storyboarding** is a visual method used to predict and explore the
    user experience with a product or service. A storyboard in HCI is
    typically a sequence of drawings with annotations that represent a
    user's interactions with technology. This technique is borrowed from
    the film and animation industry and is used in HCI to convey a
    sequence of events or user flows, including the user's actions,
    reactions, and emotions.

-   **Wizard of Oz Studies** is a method of user testing where
    participants interact with a system they believe to be autonomous,
    but which is actually being controlled or partially controlled by a
    human 'wizard' behind the scenes. This technique allows researchers
    to simulate the response of a system that may not yet be fully
    functional or developed.

Both **Storyboarding** and **Wizard of Oz Studies** are effective for
engaging with users early in the design process. They help deal with the
problem of gathering feedback on a product that doesn't yet exist. Users
often have difficulty imagining outcomes when they cannot touch a live
demonstration.

-   **Surveys** in HCI are structured tools that consist of a series of
    questions designed to be answered by a large number of participants.
    They can be conducted online, by telephone, through paper
    questionnaires, or using computer-assisted methods. Surveys are
    useful for collecting quantitative data from a broad audience, which
    can be analyzed statistically.

-   **Interviews** in HCI are more in-depth and involve direct, two-way
    communication between the researcher and the participant. Interviews
    can be structured, semi-structured, or unstructured, ranging from
    tightly scripted question sets to open-ended conversations.

-   **Focus Groups** involve a small group of participants discussing
    their experiences and opinions about a system or design, often with
    a moderator. Group dynamics can provide insights into collective
    user perspectives. In particular, users can bounce ideas off each
    other to provide richer feedback and quieter users who may not
    otherwise provide feedback may be encouraged by their peers.

-   **Community-Based Participatory Design (CBPD)** is a human-centered
    approach that involves the people who will use a product in the
    design and development process. With CBPD, designers work closely
    with community members to identify problems, develop prototypes, and
    iterate based on community feedback. For example, when building a
    software product for deaf people, the engineering team can hire deaf
    engineers or designers to provide feedback as they collaboratively
    build the product.

-   **Field Studies** involve observing and collecting data on how users
    interact with a system in their natural environment. This method is
    based on the premise that observing users in their context provides
    a more accurate understanding of user behavior. It can include a
    variety of techniques like ethnography, contextual inquiries, and
    natural observations.

-   **Lab-based studies** are conducted in a controlled environment
    where the researchers can manipulate variables and observe user
    behavior in a setting designed to minimize external influences.
    Common lab-based methods include usability testing, controlled
    experiments, and eye-tracking studies.

-   **Diary Studies and Ethnography** in HCI are a research method where
    participants are asked to keep a record of their interactions with a
    system or product over a while. This log may include text, images,
    and sometimes even audio or video recordings, depending on the
    study's design. Participants typically document their activities,
    thoughts, feelings, and frustrations as they occur in their natural
    context.

-   **Ethnography** is a qualitative research method that involves
    observing and interacting with participants in their real-life
    environment. Ethnographers aim to immerse themselves in the user
    environment to get a deep understanding of the cultural, social, and
    organizational contexts that shape technology use.

As we have explored various methodologies for collecting human feedback,
it becomes evident that the role of human input is indispensable in
shaping AI systems that are not only effective but also ethically sound
and user-centric. In the next step, we will elaborate on how to design
AI systems for positive human impact, examining how socially aware and
human-centered approaches can be employed to ensure that AI technologies
contribute meaningfully to society. This includes understanding how AI
can be utilized to address real-world challenges and create tangible
benefits for individuals and communities.

### Designing AI for Positive Human Impact

In the field of natural language processing (NLP), the primary focus has
traditionally been on quantitative metrics such as performance
benchmarks, accuracy, and computations. These metrics have long guided
the development and evaluation of the technologies. However, as the
field evolves and becomes increasingly intertwined with human
interactions like the recent popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs),
a paradigm shift is becoming increasingly necessary. For example, these
LLMs are shown to produce unethical or harmful responses or reflect
values that only represent a certain group of people. The need for a
human-centered approach in NLP development is crucial as these models
are much more likely to be utilized in a broad spectrum of human-centric
applications, impacting various aspects of daily life. This shift calls
for an inclusive framework where LLMs are not only optimized for
efficiency and accuracy but are also sensitized to ethical, cultural,
and societal contexts. Integrating a human-centered perspective ensures
that these models are developed with a deep understanding of, and
respect for, the diversity and complexity of human values and social
norms. This approach goes beyond merely preventing harmful outcomes; it
also focuses on enhancing the positive impact of NLP technologies on
society. In this session, we explore the intricacies of a human-centered
approach in NLP development, focusing on three key themes: Socially
Aware, Human-Centered, and Positively Impactful.

#### Socially Aware

In the exploration of socially aware NLP,  [@hovy-yang-2021-importance]
presents a comprehensive taxonomy of seven social factors grounded in
linguistic theory (See @fig-taxonomy).

![Taxonomy of social factors](Figures/seven-taxonomy.png){#fig-taxonomy
width="30%"}

This taxonomy illustrates both the current limitations and progressions
in NLP as they pertain to each of these factors. The primary aim is to
motivate the NLP community to integrate these social factors more
effectively, thereby advancing towards a level of language understanding
that more closely resembles human capabilities. The characteristics of
speakers, encompassing variables such as age, gender, ethnicity, social
class, and dialect, play a crucial role in language processing. Certain
languages or dialects, often categorized as low-resource, are spoken by
vulnerable populations that require special consideration in NLP
systems. In many cases, the dominant culture and values are
over-represented, leading to an inadvertent marginalization of minority
perspectives. These minority voices must be not only recognized but also
given equitable representation in language models. Additionally, norms
and context are vital components in understanding linguistic behavior.
They dictate the appropriateness of language use in various social
situations and settings. Recognizing and adapting to these norms is a
critical aspect of developing socially aware NLP systems that can
effectively function across diverse social environments.

#### Human-Centered

The Human-Centered aspect of NLP development emphasizes the creation of
language models that prioritize the needs, preferences, and well-being
of human users. This involves integrating human-centered design
principles throughout the development stages of LLMs, which are
described as follows:

-   **Task Formulation stage:** Human-centered NLP development begins
    with understanding the specific problems and contexts in which users
    operate. This involves collaborating with end-users to identify
    their needs and challenges, ensuring that the tasks addressed by the
    models are relevant and meaningful to them. By engaging with users
    early in the process, developers can create models that are not only
    technically robust but also practically useful.

-   **Data Collection stage:** Human-centered principles ensure that the
    data used to train models is representative of the diverse user
    population. This includes collecting data from various demographic
    groups, languages, and cultural contexts to avoid biases that could
    lead to unfair or harmful outcomes. Ethical considerations are
    paramount, ensuring that data is collected with informed consent and
    respecting users' privacy.

-   **Data Processing** in a human-centered approach involves carefully
    curating and annotating data to reflect the nuances of human
    language and behavior. This step includes filtering out potentially
    harmful content, addressing imbalances in the data, and ensuring
    that the labels and annotations are accurate and meaningful. By
    involving human annotators from diverse backgrounds, developers can
    capture a wider range of perspectives and reduce the risk of biased
    outputs.

-   **Model Training** with a human-centered focus involves
    incorporating feedback from users and domain experts to fine-tune
    the models. This iterative process ensures that the models remain
    aligned with users' needs and preferences. Techniques such as active
    learning, where the model queries users for the most informative
    examples, can be employed to improve the model's performance.

-   **Model Evaluation** in a human-centered framework goes beyond
    traditional metrics like accuracy and F1-score. It includes
    assessing the model's impact on users, its fairness, and its ability
    to handle real-world scenarios. User studies and A/B testing can
    provide valuable insights into how the model performs in practice
    and how it affects users' experiences.

-   **Deployment** of human-centered NLP models involves continuous
    monitoring and feedback loops to ensure that the models remain
    effective and aligned with users' needs over time. This includes
    setting up mechanisms for users to report issues and provide
    feedback, which can then be used to update and improve the models.
    Ensuring transparency in how the models operate and how user data is
    used also fosters trust and acceptance among users.

#### Positively Impactful

Building on the human-centered approach, it is crucial to consider how
language models can be utilized and the broader impacts they can have on
society.

**Utilization:** LLMs offer socially beneficial applications across
various domains such as public policy, mental health, and education. In
public policy, they assist in analyzing large volumes of data to inform
decision-making processes. In mental health, LLMs can provide
personalized therapy and even train therapists by simulating patient
interactions. In the education sector, they enable personalized learning
experiences and language assistance, making education more accessible
and effective. These examples demonstrate the versatility of LLMs in
contributing positively to critical areas of human life.

**Impact:** The deployment of NLP models, especially LLMs, has
significant societal impacts. Positively, they enhance human
productivity and creativity, offering tools and insights that streamline
processes and foster innovative thinking. LLMs serve as powerful aids in
various sectors, from education to industry, enhancing efficiency and
enabling new forms of expression and problem-solving. it is essential to
acknowledge the potential negative impacts. One major concern is the
ability of LLMs to generate and spread misinformation. As these models
become more adept at producing human-like text, distinguishing between
AI-generated and human-created content becomes increasingly challenging.
This raises issues of trust and reliability, with the risk of widespread
dissemination of false or misleading information, which could have
significant adverse effects on individuals and society.

By considering both the utilization and impact of LLMs, we can better
harness their potential for positive societal contributions while
mitigating the risks associated with their deployment. In conclusion, by
thoughtfully integrating human-centered principles and ensuring positive
impacts through feedback collection and ethical considerations, we can
develop language models that not only enhance human well-being but also
align closely with societal values. Building on these foundational
principles, we now turn our attention to Adaptive User Interfaces, which
exemplify the practical application of these concepts by personalizing
interactions and improving user experiences in dynamic environments.

### Adaptive User Interfaces

Adaptive user interfaces (AUIs) represent a significant advancement in
personalizing user experiences by learning and adapting to individual
preferences. This section will discuss the methodologies and
applications of AUIs, highlighting their role in enhancing human-AI
interaction through intelligent adaptation. The integration of AUIs
within human-centered design paradigms ensures that AI systems not only
meet user needs but also anticipate and adapt to their evolving
preferences, thus maximizing positive human impact. Nowadays, consumers
have more choices than ever and the need for personalized and
intelligent assistance to make sense of the vast amount of information
presented to them is clear.

#### Key ideas

In general, personalized recommendation systems require a model or
profile of the user. We categorize modeling approaches into four groups.

1.  User-created profiles (usually done manually).

2.  Manually defined groups that each user is classified
    into.

3.  Automatically learned groups that each user is
    classified into.

4.  Adaptively learned individual user models from interactions with the
    recommendation system.

The last approach is referred to as *adaptive user interfaces*. This
approach promises that each user is given the most personalization
possible, leading to better outcomes. In this session, we discuss
recommendation systems that adaptively learn an individual's preferences
and use that knowledge to intelligently recommend choices that the
individual is more inclined to like.

The problem of learning individual models can be formalized as follows: 
a set of tasks requiring a user decision, a description for each task, 
and a history of the user's decision on each task. This allows us to 
find a function that maps from task descriptions (features) to user 
decisions. Tasks can be described using crowd-sourced data (a 
collaborative approach) or measurable features of the task (a content-based 
approach). This session will focus on content-based approaches 
for describing tasks. After understanding the framework for adaptive 
user interfaces, it is useful to provide example applications to 
ground future discussions. Adaptive user interfaces have been developed 
for command and form completion, email filtering and filing, news 
selection and layout, browsing the internet, selecting movies and 
TV shows, online shopping, in-car navigation, interactive scheduling, 
and dialogue systems, among many other applications.

#### Design

The goal of an adaptive user interface is to create a software tool that
reduces human effort by acquiring a user model based on past user
interactions. This is analogous to the goal of machine learning (ML)
which is to create a software tool that improves some task performance
by acquiring knowledge based on partial task experience. The design of
an adaptive user interface can be broken up into six steps:

1.  **Formulating the Problem:** Given some task that an intelligent
    system could aid, the goal is to find a formulation that lets the
    assistant improve its performance over time by learning from
    interactions with a user. In this step the designer has to make
    design choices about what aspect of user behavior is predicted, and
    what is the proper level of granularity for description (i.e. what
    is a training example). This step usually involves formulating the
    problem into some sort of supervised learning framework.

2.  **Engineering the Representation:** At this stage we have a
    formulation of a task in ML terms and we need to represent the
    behavior and user model in such a way that makes computational
    learning not only tractable but as easy as possible. In this step,
    the designer has to make design choices about what information is
    used to make predictions, and how that information is encoded and
    passed to the model.

3.  **Collecting User Traces:** In this third step the goal is to find
    an effective way to collect traces (samples) of user behavior. The
    designer must choose how to translate traces into training data and
    also how to elicit traces from a user. An ideal adaptive user
    interface places no extra effort on the user to collect such traces.

4.  **Modeling the User:** In this step the designer must decide what
    model class to use (neural network, decision tree, graphical model,
    etc.) and how to train the model (optimizer, step size, batch size,
    etc.). This step in the design process is usually given too much
    importance in academia. It is quite often the case that the success
    of an adaptive user interface is more sensitive to the other design
    steps.

5.  **Using the Model Effectively:** At this stage the designer must
    decide how the model will be integrated into a software tool.
    Specifically, when and how is the model evaluated and how is the
    output of the model presented to the user? In addition, the designer
    must consider how to handle situations in which the model
    predictions are wrong. An ideal adaptive user interface will let the
    user take advantage of good predictions and ignore bad ones.

6.  **Gaining User Acceptance:** The final step in the design process is
    to get users to try the system and ultimately adopt it. The initial
    attraction of users is often a marketing problem, but to retain
    users the system must be well-designed and easy to use.

#### Applications

After understanding the design of Adaptive User Interfaces, let's take a
look at how we can apply it to real-world problems. We will summarize
and analyze three different application areas of learning human
preferences, which are driving route advisor [@rogers1999adaptive],
destination selection [@langley1999adaptive], and resource scheduling
[@gervasio1999learning].

**1. Driving Route Advisor:** The task of route selection involves
determining a desirable path for a driver to take from their current
location to a chosen destination, given the knowledge of available roads
from a digital map. While computational route advisors exist in rental
cars and online, they cannot personalize individual drivers'
preferences, which is a gap that adaptive user interfaces aim to fill by
learning and recommending routes tailored to the driver's unique choices
and behaviors.

Here is an approach to route selection through learning individual
drivers' route preferences.

-   Formulation: Learn a "subjective" function to evaluate entire
    routes.

-   Representation: Global route features are computable from digital
    maps.

-   Data collection: Preference of one complete route over another.

-   Induction: A method for learning weights from preference data.

-   Using model: Apply subjective function to find "optimal" route.

This method aims to learn a user model that considers the entirety of a
route, thereby avoiding issues like data fragmentation and credit
assignment problems.

The design choices are incorporated into [@rogers1999adaptive], which:
models driver preferences in terms of 14 global route features; gives
the driver two alternative routes he might take; lets the driver refine
these choices along route dimensions; uses driver choices to refine its
model of his preferences; and invokes the driver model to recommend
future routes. We note that providing drivers with choices lets the
system collect data on route preferences in an unobtrusive manner. The
interface of the application is presented in @fig-exp-1.

![The adaptive route advisor.](Figures/example-1.png){#fig-exp-1
width="80%"}

In driving route advisor task [@rogers1999adaptive], a linear model is
used for predicting the cost of a route based on the time, distance,
number of intersections, and the number of turns. The system uses each
training pair as a constraint on the weights found during the learning
process. The experimental results are shown in the @fig-exp-2.

<figcaption>(Left) Experiments with 24 subjects show the Route Advisor

Analyses also show that personalized user models produce better results
than generalized models, even when given more data. </figcaption>
</figure>

**2. Destination Selection:** The task of destination selection involves
assisting a driver in identifying one or more suitable destinations that
fulfill a specific goal, such as finding a place to eat lunch, based on
the driver's current location and knowledge of nearby options. While
there are many recommendation systems online, including those for
restaurants, they are not ideally suited for drivers due to the driving
environment's demand for limited visual attention, thus necessitating a
more tailored and accessible approach for in-car use.

One approach to destination recommendation can be cast as:

-   Formulation: Learn to predict features the user cares about in
    items.

-   Representation: Conditions/weights on attributes and values.

-   Data collection: Converse with the user to help him make decisions,
    noting whether he accepts or rejects questions and items.

-   Induction: Any supervised induction method.

-   Using model: Guide the dialogue by selecting informative questions
    and suggesting likely values.

This design relies on the idea of a conversational user interface.
Spoken-language versions of this approach appear well suited to the
driving environment.

This approach is implemented in [@langley1999adaptive], where it engages
in spoken conversations to help a user refine goals; incorporates a
dialogue model to constrain this process; collects and stores traces of
interaction with the user; and personalizes both its questions and
recommended items. Their work focused on recommending restaurants to
users who want advice about where to eat. This approach to
recommendation would work well for drivers, it also has broader
applications. We present experimental results in

<figure id="fig-exp-2.5">
<p><img src="Figures/example-4.png" style="width:45.0%" alt="image" />
<img src="Figures/example-5.png" style="width:45.0%" alt="image" /></p>
<figcaption>(Left) Speech Acts Per Conversation. (Right) Time Per
Conversation. </figcaption>
</figure>

**3. Resource Scheduling:** The task of resource scheduling describes
the challenge of allocating a limited set of resources to complete a set
of tasks or jobs within a certain time frame, while also considering the
constraints on both the jobs and the resources. Although automated
scheduling systems are prevalent in various industries and some
interactive schedulers exist, there is a distinct need for systems that
can create personalized schedules reflecting the unique preferences of
individual users.

An approach to personalized scheduling can be described as:

-   Formulation: Learn a utility function to evaluate entire schedules.

-   Representation: Global features are computable from the schedule.

-   Data collection: Preference of one candidate schedule over others.

-   Induction: A method for learning weights from preference data.

-   Using model: Apply the 'subjective' function to find a good
    schedule.

We note that this method is similar to that in the Adaptive Route
Advisor. However, it assumes a search through a space of complete
schedules (a repair space), which requires some initial schedule. This
approach is implemented in [@gervasio1999learning], where the
interactive scheduler retrieves an initial schedule from a personalized
case library; suggests to the user improved schedules from which to
select; lets the user direct search to improve on certain dimensions;
collects user choices to refine its personalized utility function;
stores solutions in the case base to initialize future schedules; and
invokes the user model to recommend future schedule repairs. As before,
providing users with choices lets the system collect data on schedule
preferences unobtrusively. An example of the interface, and the
experimental results are shown in @fig-exp-3.

<figure id="fig-exp-3">
<p><img src="Figures/example-7.png" style="width:45.0%" alt="image" />

<figcaption>(Left) The interface of the INCA: Interactive
Scheduling <span class="citation"

suggest that retrieving personalized schedules helps users more as task
difficulty increases. These experimental studies used a mixture of human
and synthetic subjects. </figcaption>

#### Limitations

The challenges of adaptive interfaces may involve: conceptualizing user
modeling as a task suitable for inductive learning, crafting
representations that facilitate the learning process, gathering training
data from users in a way that doesn't intrude on their experience,
applying the learned user model effectively, ensuring the system can
learn in real-time, and dealing with the necessity of learning from a
limited number of training instances. These challenges are not only
pertinent to adaptive interfaces but also intersect with broader
applications of machine learning, while also introducing some unique
issues. However, new sensor technology can bring promises to adaptive
interfaces. Adaptive interfaces rely on user traces to drive their
modeling process, so they stand to benefit from developments like GPS
and cell phone locators, robust software for speech recognition,
accurate eye and head trackers, real-time video interpreters, wearable
body sensors (GSR, heart rate), and portable brain-wave sensors. As
those devices become more widespread, they will offer new sources of
data and support new types of adaptive services. In addition, adaptive
interfaces can be viewed as a form of cognitive simulation that
automatically generates knowledge structures to learn user preferences.
They are capable of making explicit predictions about future user
behavior and explaining individual differences through the process of
personalization. This perspective views adaptive interfaces as tools
that not only serve functional purposes but also model the psychological
aspects of user interaction. Two distinct approaches within cognitive
simulation are related to adaptive interfaces: *process* models that
incorporate fundamental architectural principles, and *content* models
that operate at the knowledge level, focusing on behavior. We note that
both of them have roles to play, but content models are more relevant to
personalization and adaptive interfaces.

In conclusion, adaptive user interfaces represent a significant
advancement in creating personalized and efficient interactions between
humans and technology. By leveraging modern sensor technologies and
cognitive simulation approaches, these interfaces can dynamically learn
and adapt to individual user preferences, enhancing overall user
experience and system effectiveness. The methodologies discussed, from
conceptualizing user models to collecting and utilizing user feedback,
form the foundation of this innovative approach. As we transition to the
next section, we will explore practical applications and real-world
implementations of these human-centered AI principles through detailed
case studies, illustrating the tangible impact of adaptive interfaces in
various domains.

### Case Studies in Human-Centered AI

In this section, we examine practical examples that illustrate the
application of human-centered principles in the development and
deployment of AI systems. By examining these case studies, we aim to
provide concrete insights into how AI technologies can be designed and
implemented to better align with human values, enhance inclusivity, and
address the specific needs of diverse user groups. The following case
studies highlight different approaches and methodologies used to ensure
that AI systems are not only effective but also considerate of the human
experience.

#### LaMPost Case Study

In our exploration of human-centered AI design, it is crucial to examine
how metrics can be improved to better capture the human experience and
address the shortcomings of traditional evaluation methods. The LaMPost
case study [@goodman_lampost_2022] exemplifies this effort by focusing
on the development of an AI assistant designed to aid individuals with
dyslexia in writing emails. This case is particularly relevant to our
discussion because it highlights the importance of human-centered
principles in AI development, especially in creating tools that cater to
specific cognitive differences and enhance user experience.

Dyslexia is a cognitive difference that affects approximately 15 percent
of language users, with varying degrees of impact on speaking, spelling,
and writing abilities. It is a spectrum disorder, meaning symptoms and
severity differ among individuals. More importantly, dyslexia is not an
intellectual disability; many individuals with dyslexia possess high
intelligence. Given the significant number of people affected by
dyslexia, it is essential to develop AI tools that support their unique
needs and enhance their daily tasks.

The LaMPost project sought to answer the question, "How can LLMs be
applied to enhance the writing workflows of adults with dyslexia?" To
address this, researchers employed a participatory design approach,
involving employees with dyslexia from their company (Google) in the
study. This approach ensured that the development process was inclusive
and responsive to the actual needs and preferences of the dyslexic
community. By focusing on the real-world application of LLMs in aiding
email writing for dyslexic individuals, LaMPost serves as a powerful
example of how AI can be designed to better capture and enhance the
human experience.

The figure below allows users to see suggestions for rewriting selected
text, helping them identify main ideas, suggest possible changes, and
rewrite their selections to improve clarity and expression.

![The Suggest Possible Changes feature from
LaMPost.](Figures/lampost_fig3.png)

The table below categorizes the challenges faced by users at different
writing levels and the strategies they can use to overcome these
challenges, illustrating the varied support needs addressed by LaMPost

</figure>

Next, they ran a focus group to get initial ideas from members of the
dyslexic community. This focus group helped them figure out what to
measure and added the second research question: "How do adults with
dyslexia feel about LLM-assisted writing?" In other words, how does the
LLM impact users' feelings of satisfaction, self-expression,
self-efficacy, autonomy, and control?

From this focus group, they went and created a prototype to answer the
desires of the group. They included three features in their prototype
model. One feature was: *identifying main ideas*. They focused on this
to support overall clarity and organization of high-level ideas of the
user. Another feature was *suggest possible changes*. They focused on
this because users wanted to identify high-level adjustments to improve
their writing. The last feature they added was *rewrite my selections*.
They added this because users wanted help expressing ideas with a
desired phrasing tone or style. This feature generated a rewrite based
on a command you gave it.

With the prototype, the researchers evaluated again with 19 participants
with dyslexia from outside their organization. They did a three-part
study, including a demonstration and background on the system (25 min).
Then they did a writing exercise with two real tasks (emails) each user
had to do in the real world (25 min). For example, one task might have
been to write an email to the principal of their child's school to ask
for a meeting. Then, the researchers did another follow-up interview for
more qualitative data, e.g. to ask about specific choices users made
when interacting with the model (25 min).

LaMPost's design prioritized autonomy by allowing users to choose the
best option for their writing. One successful thing is that most users
felt in control while writing. Users found that numerous options were
helpful to filter through poor results. However, participants said the
selection process was cognitively demanding and time-consuming. As we
all know, features identified in LaMPost are all over the place, such as
in Google Docs. Nonetheless, there remain many questions about the
balance between automated writing and providing more control to the end
users.

::: tcolorbox
How could researchers hone in on this trade-off between **the ease of
automated writing** and **providing control to end-users**?\
You will need to design a study to approach this question.

-   Identify your research question, hypotheses, and the methods that
    you will use. (Hint: use the HCI methods described in the previous
    section.)

-   Scope the domain of your study appropriately---more broadly than
    dyslexia but not so broadly to be meaningless.

-   What domains will you include? (E.g. students use ChatGPT for
    assignments, doctors use an LLM to write notes, etc.)
:::

In this way, both the case study of LaMPost and its presaging of greater
trends in LLM interfaces recapitulate the maxim of HCI: HCI is a cycle.
You design a potential system, prototype it, get feedback from people,
and iterate constantly. Next, we will explore two case studies that
exemplify the application of human-centered principles in NLP. These
case studies illustrate how LLMs can be adapted to foster social
inclusivity and provide training in social skills.

#### Multi-Value and DaDa: Cross-Dialectal English NLP

English NLP systems are largely trained to perform well in Standard
American English - the form of written English found in professional
settings and elsewhere. Not only is Standard American English the most
well-represented form of English in textual datasets but NLP engineers
and researchers often filter dialectal and vernacular English examples
from their datasets to improve performance on SAE benchmarks. As a
result, NLP systems are generally less performant when processing
dialectal inputs than SAE inputs. This performance gap is observable
over various benchmarks and tasks, like the SPIDER benchmark. [@spider]

![Stress test reveals worse performance on the SPIDER benchmark with
synthetic dialectical examples than with
SAE.](Figures/MV2.png){width="100%"}

As natural language systems become more pervasive, this performance gap
increasingly represents a real allocational harm against dialectal
English speakers --- these speakers are excluded from using helpful
systems and assistants. Multi-Value is a framework for evaluating
foundation language models on dialectic input, and DADA is a framework
for adapting LLMs to improve performance on dialectic input.

**Synthetic Dialectal Data**

Ziems et al. (2023) create synthetic dialectal data for several English
dialects (Appalachian English, Chicano English, Indian English,
Colloquial Singapore English, and Urban African American English).[@mv]
They created synthetic data based on transforming SAE examples to have
direct evaluation comparisons. These synthetic examples were created by
leveraging known linguistic features of the dialects, such as negative
concord in UAAVE. @fig-features_dialects maps out the presence of various
linguistic features.

![A comparative distribution of features in five
dialects.](Figures/MV1.png){#fig-features_dialects width="100%"}

This synthetic data, while somewhat limited in the variety of samples.
can produce and create realistic examples for benchmarking LM
performance. @fig-synthetic_example demonstrates creating a synthetic
dialectic example using the 'give passive' linguistic feature,
illustrating the transformation process from SAE to a vernacular form.

![Execution of a sample transform using a documented linguistic
feature.](Figures/MV3.png){#fig-synthetic_example width="40%"}

**Feature Level Adapters** One approach to the LLM adaption task would
be to train an adapter for each dialect using a parameter-efficient
fine-tuning method like low-rank adapters. [@lora] While adapters can
certainly bridge the gap between SAE LMs and dialect inputs, this
approach suffers from a couple of weaknesses, namely:

-   Individually trained adapters do not leverage similarities between
    low-resource dialects. Transfer learning is often helpful for
    training low-resource languages and dialects.

-   The model needs to know which adapter to use at inference time. This
    presupposes that we can accurately classify the dialect ---
    sometimes based on as little as one utterance. This classification
    is not always possible --- a more general approach is needed.

Therefore, Liu et al. (2023) propose a novel solution --- DADA: Dialect
Adaption via Dynamic Aggregation of Linguistic Rules. [@dada] DADA
trains adapters on the linguistic feature level rather than the dialect
level. The model can use multiple linguistic feature adapters via an
additional fusion layer. They can therefore train using
multi-dialectical data and cover linguistic variation via a
comprehensive set of roughly 200 adapters. DADA saw an improvement in
performance over single-dialect adapters for most dialects, as shown in
@fig-dada_performance.

![Execution of a sample transform using a documented linguistic
feature.](Figures/MV4.png){#fig-dada_performance width="40%"}

The Multi-Value and DADA case study underscores the importance of
designing NLP systems that are inclusive and representative of diverse
language users. By addressing the performance gaps in handling dialectal
inputs, this case study highlights the necessity of incorporating
diverse linguistic data and creating adaptable systems. This approach
enhances AI functionality and accessibility, ensuring it respects and
reflects linguistic diversity. Ultimately, the study reinforces
human-centered design principles, demonstrating how AI can be tailored
to better serve and empower all users. Moving forward, we will explore
how LLMs can be utilized for social skill training, showcasing their
potential to improve human interactions.

#### Social Skill Training via LLMs

The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) marks a significant
milestone in the field of social skills training. This case study
explores the potential of LLMs to augment social skill development
across diverse scenarios. More specifically, we discuss a dual-framework
approach, where two distinct LLMs operate in tandem as a Partner and a
Mentor, guiding human learners in their journey towards improved social
interaction. In this framework, we have two agents which are

-   **AI Partner**: LLM-empowered agents that users can engage with
    across various topics. This interactive model facilitates practical,
    conversation-based learning, enabling users to experiment with
    different communication styles and techniques or practice and
    develop specific skills in real-world scenarios in a safe,
    AI-mediated environment.

-   **AI Mentor**: An LLM-empowered entity designed to provide
    constructive, personalized feedback based on the interaction of
    users and the AI Partner. This mentor analyzes conversation
    dynamics, identifies areas for improvement, offers tailored advice,
    and guides users toward effective social strategies and improved
    interaction skills.

For example, in conflict resolution, individuals learning to handle
difficult conversations can use the AI Partner to simulate interactions
with a digitalized partner. As a Conflict Resolution Expert, the AI
Mentor helps analyze these interactions, offering strategies to navigate
conflicts effectively.

In the educational sector, K-12 teachers aiming to incorporate more
growth-mindset language into their teaching can practice with a
digitalized student. An experienced teacher or mentor, represented by
the AI Mentor, provides insights on effective communication and teaching
methods. For negotiation training, students preparing to negotiate their
first job offers can engage in simulated negotiations with a digitalized
HR representative through the AI Partner. As a Negotiation Expert, the
AI Mentor then offers guidance on negotiation tactics, helping students
effectively articulate their values and negotiate job terms. Lastly, in
therapy training, novice therapists can interact with a digitalized
patient via the AI Partner to practice therapy sessions. The AI Mentor,
functioning as a Therapy Coach, then reviews these sessions, providing
feedback and suggestions on enhancing therapeutic techniques and patient
engagement.

**CARE: Therapy Skill Training** Hsu et al. (2023) introduced
CARE [@hsu2023helping], a framework designed for therapy skill training.
This framework leverages a simulated environment, enabling counselors to
practice their skills without the risk of harming real individuals. An
integral component of CARE is the AI Mentor, which offers invaluable
feedback and guidance during the training process. See
@fig-care for
the overview of the framework.

![CARE Framework](Figures/care.png){#fig-care width="45%"}

CARE's primary function is for novice therapists and counselors to
assess and determine the most effective counseling strategies tailored
to specific contexts. It provides counselors with customized example
responses, which they can adopt, adapt, or disregard when interacting
with a simulated support seeker. This approach is deeply rooted in the
principles of Motivational Interviewing and utilizes a rich dataset of
counseling conversations combined with LLMs. The effectiveness of CARE
has been established through rigorous quantitative evaluations and
qualitative user studies, which included simulated chats and
semi-structured interviews. Notably, CARE has shown significant benefits
in aiding novice counselors. From the assessment, counselors chose to
use CARE 93% of the time, directly used a CARE response without editing
60% of the time, and sent more extended responses with CARE.
Qualitatively, counselors noted several advantages of CARE, such as its
ability to refresh memory on various strategies, inspire innovative
responses, boost confidence, and save time during consultations.
However, there were some drawbacks, including potential disruptions in
the thought process, perceived limitations in response options, the
requirement for decision-making, and the time needed to review
suggestions. Overall, the framework is particularly beneficial for
therapists new to the field, offering them a supportive and educational
tool to enhance their counseling skills effectively.
